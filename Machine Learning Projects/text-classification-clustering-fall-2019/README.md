This project uses MEDLINE articles, which are uniquely identified with their corresponding PubMed ID, with their abstract and title. NLP techniques, such as unigrams and TF-IDF, were used to obtain features to classify/predict the articles to a MeSH term. Additionally, KMeans clustering was used as a feature engineering technique to classify/predict. A SVM classifier (LinearSVC) was used to make a binary yes/no prediction.
