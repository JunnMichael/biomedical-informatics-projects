METHOD: P. multiflorum water-eluted fraction (RW), 50% ethanol-eluted fraction (R50) and 95% ethanol-eluted fraction (R95) were successively obtained from 70% ethanol extracts of P. multiflorum, after being eluted by water, 50% ethanol and 95% ethanol and then absorbed by AB-8 macroporous resin. Normal human liver L02 cells and liver cancer HepG2 cells were incubated with cell supernatants from different fractions and cells. MTT method and inverted microscope were adopted to observe the impact of L02 on growth of HepG2 cells, screening fractions with damage effect and detect their doses and time effect. Giemsa stain showed changes in cell nucleus after administration and flow cytometry analysis was used to detect cycle and apoptosis of L02 cells. RESULT: MTT method and inverted microscope showed that R50 had significant growth inhibition effects on L02 and HepG2 cells. According to giemsa stain and flow cytometry analysis, R50 showed different effect on inducing the two cells: there  are much more apoptotic HepG2 cells than apoptotic L02 cells in each time phase (the proportion of the apoptosis cells in HepG2 group were 83.62%, 60.52% and 74.49%, and ID2 31.02%, 20.57% and 25.32% after treated with R50 for 24, 48, 72 h.

RESULTS: High expression of miR-21 was observed in cervical cancer and Hela cell, while low expression was observed in normal cervical tissue. The relative quantification of miR-21 in cerveical cancer was 11.3196 times that of miR-21 in normal cervical tissue (P < 0.05). The expression levels of miR-143 and miR-373 in cervical cancer and Hela cell were lower than those of normal cervical tissue.

METHODS: Here we isolated fetal liver kinase-1-positive (Flk1+) cells from CML patients and we tested their biological characteristics. In addition, endothelial and hematopoietic differentiation assays were also performed to test their cancer stem cell ability. RESULTS: We found these cells expressed the BCR/ABL specific CML oncogene. Co-culture assay also indicated they could promote HSC blast colonies. Further studies showed they could differentiate not only into endothelial lineages but also into erythroid cells at the single-cell level.

This implies that breast cancer cells, during their subclinical period, are likely to have been exposed for a considerable time to endogenous sex hormones and endogenous hormonal milieu predicts the chances of breast cancer in  females. So, we planned this study to evaluate the role of endogenous hormones in postmenopausal females excluding the patients on hormone replacement therapy as the relationship between breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy is well known. METHODS: Hormone therapy is known to affect these hormone levels but whether treatment of breast cancer per se also decreases the hormone levels is not known. We planned the present study to determine hormone levels in patients before and after 4 months of treatment (chemotherapy/surgery and radiotherapy). Circulating hormone levels were measured using a chemiluminescence method. Their  results were compared with a group of 25 age matched healthy controls. RESULTS: We found that serum prolactin, testosterone and estrogen levels were very significantly higher in patients before treatment (Group I) as compared to controls (Group III). Serum prolactin and serum estrogen levels were significantly higher and serum testosterone was very significantly higher in patients before treatment (Group I) when compared after 4 months of treatment (Group II). Only serum estrogen levels were significantly high in patients after  treatment (Group II) as compared to controls (Group III). Serum progesterone levels showed no significant difference to any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that postmenopausal females with breast cancer have abnormalities in hormone levels. These abnormalities may be considered in the pathogenesis of the  disease and should be taken into account in the treatment of patients of breast cancer. It might also be helpful to delay the onset of cancer by normalizing the  levels of these hormones and in deciding the treatment modality for the patients  once breast cancer has been diagnosed but further studies are required to prove the benefit of measuring serum hormone levels as a screening test.\",\n",

METHODS: We developed an easy technique to determine the 25-OH vitamin D status from dried blood samples on filter paper. This allows determination of the 25-OH vitamin D status independently of venous blood taking, since only sampling of capillary blood is required for this new method. We compared the results of vitamin D measurements from venous blood of 96 healthy blood donors with those from capillary blood taken from the same patients at the  same time. The capillary blood was dried on filter paper using the D-Vital ID dry-blood collection system. RESULTS: 25-OH vitamin D concentration data from extracted dried capillary blood filters correlated very well with data obtained after direct measurement of venous blood samples of the same blood donor (R: 0.7936; p < 0.0001). The correlation was linear over the whole range of 25-OH vitamin D concentrations seen in this study. A Bland-Altman plot revealed good agreement between both tests. CONCLUSIONS: The D-Vital ID dry-blood collection system showed an excellent performance as compared to the classical way of 25-OH  vitamin D measurement from venous blood.

METHODS: We review principles for nested case-control study design in relation to biomarker discovery studies and describe how the efficiency of biomarker discovery can be effected by study design choices. We develop a simulated prostate cancer cohort data set and a series of biomarker discovery case-control studies nested within the cohort to illustrate how study design choices can influence biomarker discovery process. RESULT: Common elements of nested case-control design, incidence density sampling and matching of controls to cases are not typically factored correctly into biomarker discovery analyses, inducing bias in the discovery process. We illustrate how incidence density sampling and matching of controls to cases reduce the apparent  specificity of truly valid biomarkers 'discovered' in a nested case-control study. We also propose and demonstrate a new case-control matching protocol, we call 'antimatching', that improves the efficiency of biomarker discovery studies.

The present study clarifies the prognosis and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy for different stages of bladder cancer that invade perivesical fat.  OBJECTIVE: * To assess the prognosis of pT2b, pT3a and pT3b bladder cancers after radical cystectomy (RC) in order to define potential situations where chemotherapy may be of benefit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: * Between 1985 and 2009, 903 patients underwent a RC and pelvic bilateral lymphadenectomy in an Institutional Referral Centre. * In all, 87 patients (9.6%) had a pT2b tumour, 111 patients (12.3%) a pT3a tumour, and 129 patients (14.3%) a pT3b tumour. * The median (range) overall follow-up was 23 (1-350) months. * Overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS), metastases-free (MFS) and local recurrence-free survival  (LRFS) was estimated and compared using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank test. RESULTS: * The 5-year survivals pT2b and pT3a were similar for LRFS (86% vs 84%), MFS (69% vs 63%), DSS (72% vs 70%) and OS (66% vs 61%), and the prognosis was better than for pT3b stage tumours (69%, 44%, 40%, and 31% respectively). * In pN0 disease, MFS differences between pT2b-pT3a and pT3b tumours were not significant in patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy (MSF of 87%, 69% and 56%, respectively) while they were significant in patients without adjuvant chemotherapy (MFS of 70%, 68% and 42%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: * Bladder cancers invading perivesical tissue macroscopically have a greater propensity to  produce lymph node metastases, local recurrence, and have lower MFS, DSS, and OS. In pN0 disease, pT3b tumours may receive more benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. * Our results could be a useful for selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.\",\n",

OBJECTIVE: * To examine the long-term outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP) among men diagnosed  with prostate cancer from the screening and control arms of the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: * Among 42,376 men randomised during the period of the first round of the trial (1993-1999), 1151 and 210 in the screening and control arms were diagnosed with prostate cancer, respectively. * Of these men, 420 (36.5%) screen-detected and 54 (25.7%) controls underwent RP with long-term follow-up data (median follow-up 9.9 years). * Progression-free (PFS), metastasis-free (MFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were examined, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether screen-detected (vs control) was associated with RP outcomes after adjusting for  standard predictors. RESULTS: * RP cases from the screening and control arms had  statistically similar clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score, although screen-detected cases had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at diagnosis. * Men from the screening arm had a significantly higher PFS  (P = 0.003), MFS (P < 0.001) and CSS (P = 0.048). * In multivariable models adjusting for age, PSA level, clinical stage, and biopsy Gleason score, the screening group had a significantly lower risk of biochemical recurrence (hazard  ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.83, P = 0.011) and metastasis (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.59, P = 0.005). * Additionally adjusting for tumour volume and other RP pathology features, there was no longer a significant  difference in biochemical recurrence between the screening and control arms. * Limitations of the present study include lead-time bias and non-randomised treatment selection. CONCLUSIONS: * After RP, screen-detected cases had significantly improved PFS, MFS and CSS compared with controls within the available follow-up time. * The screening arm remained significantly associated with lower rates of biochemical recurrence and metastasis after adjusting for other preoperative variables. * However, considering also RP pathology, the improved outcomes in the screening group appeared to be mediated by a significantly lower tumour volume.\",\n",

The structure and organization of chromatin play an important role in spatial arrangement of genes inside the nucleus thereby allowing different machineries to activate or silence the transcription of genes  governed by various epigenetic events. Epigenetic modifications and dynamic changes in chromatin organization by organizer proteins have recently been shown  to play an instrumental role in regulating cancer-promoting genes. Special AT-rich binding protein (SATB1) is a unique type of global regulator that integrates higher-order chromatin organization with regulation of gene expression. Aberrant expression of SATB1 has been shown to promote breast, hepatocellular, prostate and various other cancers. In this review we highlight upon the role of SATB1in chromatin organization and as global regulator of gene expression during cancer development. The expression of SATB1 progressively increases with the progression of cancers and it dynamically reprograms the expression of genes that are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. SATB1 directly regulates the expression of ERRB2, MMP2, ABL1, E-cadherin and hence acts as key regulator in cancer development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulation of SATB1 expression would therefore be extremely essential towards designing strategies to control it. Recent studies have provided important insights into regulation of SATB1 by FOXP3 and microRNAs. In this review we evaluate the potential of SATB1 as molecular target for cancer therapy.',\n",

The best known role of pRB in preventing cancer is inhibition of cell cycle progression by controlling the exit from the cell cycle into G0/G1. In addition, increasing evidence has suggested that pRB has important roles in DNA replication during S phase and G2/M transition. The tumor suppressor function of pRB has also been demonstrated by directly promoting differentiation via cell cycle exit with specific gene expression. Inactivation of pRB function during these cell cycle phases leads to dysregulated cell proliferation and/or chromosomal instability, which are strongly linked to cancer development. Thus pRB plays important roles through multiple functions in determining cell fate, i.e., normal growth/death and differentiation, or tumor formation.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The medical oncologists at the Townsville Cancer Centre, a regional cancer centre in North Queensland, have been providing their services to rural hospitals in Townsville and Mt Isa districts via videoconferencing since 2007. INTERVENTION: Cancer care  delivery to rural sites via Townsville teleoncology model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ability of the teleoncology model to provide the following services to rural  towns: (i) specialist consultations; (ii) urgent specialist medical care; (iii) care for Indigenous patients; and (iv) remote supervision of chemotherapy administration. RESULTS: Between May 2007 and May 2011, 158 patients from 18 rural towns received a total of 745 consultations. Ten of these patients were consulted urgently and treatment plans initiated locally, avoiding interhospital  transfers. Eighteen Indigenous patients received consultative services, being accompanied by more than four to six family members. Eighty-three patients received a range of intravenous and oral chemotherapy regimens in Mt Isa and oral agents in other towns through remote supervision by medical oncologists from Townsville.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether serious disease is more likely to be present in patients who report that they take any symptoms less seriously than other people  do, and to assess the reliability of a question which can be used to identify the extent to which patients take any symptom seriously. To do this we assessed whether the likelihood of detecting colorectal cancer is higher in patients who report that they take symptoms less seriously than other people do. METHODS: Cross sectional study of 7736 patients who had colonoscopy to find colorectal cancer. Before colonoscopy, patients completed a questionnaire on bowel symptoms  and were also asked: \"Compared to other people of your age and sex, how seriously do you think you take any symptoms?\" Likelihood of detecting colorectal cancer according to responses to this question was assessed by logistic regression models, unadjusted and adjusted for symptoms and other known predictors of colorectal cancer.Question reliability was assessed in a different sample using percentage agreement and the kappa statistic for the answers given by each patient on two occasions. Agreement between patient and doctor responses was also assessed (n = 108). RESULTS: Patients who reported they took symptoms less seriously were 3.28 (95%CI: 2.02, 5.33) times more likely to have colorectal cancer than patients who took symptoms more seriously than others. The effect was smaller (1.85 (95%CI: 1.11, 3.09)), but remained statistically significant in models including symptoms and other predictors of colorectal cancer. The question was reliable: on repeat questioning, 70% of responses were in absolute agreement  and 92% were within 1 category, kappa 57%. Patient-doctor agreement was 66%, within 1 category 92%, kappa 48%. CONCLUSION: Patients who take their symptoms less seriously have a considerably higher likelihood of colorectal cancer than those who identify themselves as taking any symptoms more seriously than other people.

BACKGROUND: Although POV has a high incidence in children and may decrease parental satisfaction after surgeries, there is only one specific score  that predicts POV in children: the Eberhart's score. In this study, we report a fuzzy model that intends to predict the probability of POV in pediatric oncologic patients. Fuzzy logic is a mathematical theory that recognizes more than simple true and false values and takes into account levels of continuous variables such  as age or duration of the surgery. The fuzzy model tries to account for subjectiveness in the variables. METHODS: Preoperative potential risk factors for POV in 198 children (0-19 year old) with malignancies were collected and analyzed. Data analysis was performed with the chi-square test and logistic regression to evaluate probable risk factors for POV. A system based on fuzzy logic was developed with the risk factors found in the logistic regression, and a computational interface was created to calculate the probability of POV. RESULTS: The model showed a good performance in predicting POV. After the analysis, the model was compared with Eberhart's score in the same population and showed a better performance. CONCLUSIONS: The fuzzy score can predict the chance of POV in children with cancer with good accuracy, allowing better planning for postoperative prophylaxis of vomiting.

To date, there has not been a reliable method of maintaining this contact for renal or ureteral urothelial carcinoma. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of using a reverse thermosensitive polymer to improve dwell times of  mitomycin C (MMC) in the upper tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a porcine model, four animals were treated ureteroscopically with both upper urinary tracts receiving MMC mixed with iodinated contrast. One additional animal received MMC percutaneously. The treatment side had ureteral outflow blocked with a reverse thermosensitive polymer plug. MMC dwell time was monitored fluoroscopically and intrarenal pressures measured. Two animals were euthanized immediately, and three animals were euthanized 5 days afterward. RESULTS: In control kidneys, drainage occurred at a mean of 5.3+/-0.58 minutes. Intrarenal pressures stayed fairly stable: 9.7+/-14.0 cm H20. In treatment kidneys, dwell time was extended to 60 minutes, when the polymer was washed out. Intrarenal pressures in the treatment kidneys peaked at 75.0+/-14.7 cm H20 and reached steady state at 60 cm H20. Pressures normalized after washout of the polymer with cool saline. Average washout time was 11.8+/-9.6 minutes. No histopathologic differences were seen between the control and treatment kidneys, or with immediate compared with delayed euthanasia. CONCLUSIONS: A reverse thermosensitive polymer can retain MMC in the upper urinary tract and appears to be safe from our examination of intrarenal pressures and histopathology.

Gene and protein expressions of the analyzed transporters increase as the brain matures, with no variation in their activity for P-gp and bcrp, while the transport activity of oat3 and oatp1a4 increases during brain maturation from preterm up to adulthood. For the first time, we illustrate a downregulation of nuclear beta-catenin expression in brain capillaries when bcrp, P-gp, oat3, and oatp1a4 transporters are at their highest expression levels. In vivo activation of beta-catenin in rat brains, by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of a GSK-3 inhibitor, enhances the activity of P-gp, bcrp, oat3, and oatp1a4. Interestingly, in an in vitro BBB model consisting of a coculture of primary endothelial brain cells with astrocytes or in vivo, activation of beta-catenin enhances the mRNA expression of ET-1. Interestingly, blocking the ETA receptor for endothelin-1 in  vivo by ICV injection of a ETA antagonist decreases transporter activity mediated by the activation of beta-catenin.

AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss knowledge  accumulated the last two decades on the tumor antigen MUC1 that has put it at the top of the list as an immunotherapy reagent. They examine evidence that anti-MUC1 immunity affects tumor development and prognosis. Finally, they review two decades of immunotherapy trials targeting MUC1, focusing primarily on vaccines but also adoptive antibody and T-cell therapies. EXPERT OPINION: Most approaches  targeting MUC1 have been immunotherapies administered to date to more than 1200 patients in clinical trials. Even though these trials focused on advanced cancer, encouraging results were reported particularly for less immunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, spontaneous anti-MUC1 immune responses are associated with better prognosis or with a reduced lifetime risk of developing MUC1+ cancers. MUC1 is abnormally expressed in over 80% of all cancers. Successfully targeting this molecule could benefit over a million patients diagnosed yearly with MUC1+ tumors just in the USA.',\n",

METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive high-risk endometrial cancer patients requiring adjuvant radiation to the vaginal cuff and  regional lymph nodes were treated with vaginal cuff fiducial-based IGRT. Seventeen (65%) received sequential chemotherapy, most commonly with a sandwich technique. Brachytherapy followed external radiation in 11 patients to a median dose of 18 Gy in 3 fractions. The median external beam dose delivered was 47.5 Gy in 25 fractions. RESULTS: All 656 fractions were successfully imaged and treated. The median overall translational shift required for correction was 9.1 mm (standard deviation, 5.2 mm) relative to clinical set-up with skin tattoos. Shifts of 1 cm, 1.5 cm, and 2 cm or greater were performed in 43%, 14%, and 4% of patients, respectively. Acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity occurred in  eight patients (30%) and grade 3 toxicity occurred in one. At two years, there have been no local or regional failures and actuarial overall survival is 95%. CONCLUSION: Daily image guidance for high-risk endometrial cancer results in a low incidence of acute GI/genitourinary (GU) toxicity with uncompromised tumor control at two years. Vaginal cuff translations can be substantial and may possibly result in underdosing if not properly considered.',\n",

AREAS COVERED: We discuss the pathogenetic mechanisms of cSCC and the main therapeutic strategies available for the treatment of cSCC. EXPERT OPINION: Chemotherapy and biological therapy with Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and cis retinoic acid are active but give limited results. Recently, strategies based on  the use of molecularly target-based agents (MTA) have been used with promising results. Based on the available findings, we hypothesize that SCC cells can develop survival and resistance mechanisms to MTAs. The detection of these mechanisms could be useful in designing strategies able to overcome the latter and to potentiate the anticancer activity of MTAs. We describe the example of the EGF-dependent survival pathway elicited by IFN-alpha and the different strategies to abrogate this survival pathway. Other strategies to potentiate the antitumor activity of cytotoxic agents such as docetaxel or cisplatin are also discussed. Illuminating examples are the inhibition of multichaperone activity or the inactivation of the proteasome. In conclusion, a new dawn based upon the rationale use of MTAs is rising up in the treatment of advanced cSCC.',\n",

       " '22998497': {'AB': 'BACKGROUND: The IG20/MADD gene is overexpressed in thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines, and can contribute to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance. The ability of the MADD protein to  resist TRAIL-induced apoptosis is dependent upon its phosphorylation by Akt. Interestingly, while TRAIL induces a significant reduction in the levels of phospho-Akt (pAkt) and phospho-MADD (pMADD) in TRAIL-sensitive cells, it fails to do so in TRAIL-resistant cells. In this study, we investigated if MADD phosphorylation by Akt was contributing to TRAIL resistance in thyroid cancer cells. METHODS: We determined the susceptibility of different thyroid cancer cell lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. We tested for various TRAIL resistance factors by FACS analyses or for  IG20/MADD expression by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We determined the levels of pAkt and pMADD upon TRAIL treatment in thyroid cancer cells by Western blotting. We tested if down-modulation of IG20/MADD gene expression using shRNA or phosphorylation using a dominant negative Akt (DN-Akt) or pretreatment with LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor, could help overcome TRAIL resistance. RESULT: BCPAP and TPC1 cells were susceptible, while KTC1 and FTC133 cells were resistant, to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The differential susceptibility to TRAIL was not related to the levels of expression of death receptors, decoy receptors, or TRAIL. KTC1 and FTC133 cells showed higher levels of IG20/MADD expression relative to BCPAP and TPC1, and were rendered susceptible to TRAIL treatment upon IG20/MADD knockdown. Interestingly, upon TRAIL treatment, the pAkt and pMADD levels were reduced in TRAIL-sensitive BCPAP and TPC1 cells, while they remained unchanged in the resistant KTC1 and FTC133 cells. While expression of a constitutively active Akt  in BCPAP and TPC1 cells rendered them resistant to TRAIL, pretreating KTC1 and FTC133 cells with LY294002 rendered them TRAIL-sensitive. Moreover, expression of a DN-Akt in KTC1 and FTC133 cells reduced the levels of pAkt and pMADD and sensitized them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our results show that pMADD is an important TRAIL resistance factor in certain thyroid cancer cells and suggest that down-modulation of either IG20/MADD expression or phosphorylation can render TRAIL-resistant thyroid cancer cells sensitive to TRAIL.',\n",

High attrition rate of candidate drugs in clinical trials is a major hurdle in the development of effective therapies for pediatric solid tumors. In order to reduce the failure rate of candidate drugs in clinical trials, more effective strategies are needed to enhance the predictability of preclinical testing. AREAS COVERED: The authors have described the current trends in preclinical drug development for treating pediatric solid tumors. Furthermore, the authors review their limitations and the available remedies, with regards to  choice of models, pharmacokinetic considerations and the criteria for assessing the long-term efficacy of a candidate drug. EXPERT OPINION: In many solid tumors, common differences between pediatric and adult cancers have been observed, and therefore, clinical trials for pediatric solid tumors must be conducted on the basis of preclinical observations in pediatric solid tumor models. There is a need to invest in extensive preclinical testing on pediatric solid tumor models.  None of the preclinical models can fully recapitulate the human cancers. Therefore, these limitations must be considered while conducting a preclinical trial. The dose and schedule of drugs used for preclinical testing must be clinically relevant. While testing the efficacy of drugs, the markers of apoptosis, drug resistance, hypoxia and tumor-initiating cells can inform us about the long-term therapeutic response of a cancer.',\n",

They typically reacted with thiols such as cysteine, depleting them and allowing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Two of these compounds, azimexon and ciamexon, showed activity against tumors in clinical trials. Imexon was produced  by cyclization of 2-cyanoaziridine-1- carboxamide in the presence of hydroxide ions. The two enantiomers were prepared by a process involving chiral chromatography. They were equipotent against cultured tumor cells. Imexon also reacts with thiols and it is especially potent against multiple myeloma in cell cultures. An efficient chemical synthesis and a lyophilization formulation of imexon as a water soluble, injectible drug, were developed. In Phase I and I/II clinical trials imexon showed hints of activity against a variety of tumors, but  a randomized double-blind Phase II trial of imexon plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in pancreatic cancer showed no enhancement of activity above that of gemcitabine alone.

Gemcitabine is considered the gold chemotherapeutic standard, but only marginally improves life-span due to its chemical instability  and low cell penetrance. A new paradigm to improve Gemcitabine's therapeutic index is to administer it in nanoparticles, which favour its delivery to cells when under 500 nm in diameter. Although promising, this approach still suffers from major limitations, as the choice of nanovector used as well as its effects on Gemcitabine intracellular trafficking inside pancreatic cancer cells remain unknown. A proper elucidation of these mechanisms would allow for the elaboration of better strategies to engineer more potent Gemcitabine nanotherapeutics against pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Gemcitabine was encapsulated in two types of commonly used nanovectors, namely poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and cholesterol-based liposomes, and their physico-chemical parameters assessed in vitro. Their mechanisms of action in human pancreatic cells were compared with those of the free drug, and with each others, using cytotoxity, apoptosis and ultrastructural analyses. RESULTS: Physico-chemical analyses of both drugs showed high loading efficiencies and sizes of less than 200 nm, as assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with a drug release profile of at least one week. These profiles translated to significant cytotoxicity and apoptosis, as well as distinct intracellular trafficking mechanisms, which were most pronounced in the case of PLGem showing significant mitochondrial, cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum stresses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates how the choice of nanovector affects the mechanisms of drug action and is a crucial determinant of Gemcitabine intracellular trafficking and  potency in pancreatic cancer settings.\",\n",

AIMS: To determine the incidence of cutaneous MM and NMSC in the Channel Islands. METHODS: Data for the period 2005-2009 were obtained from clinical and histopathological records for all MMs excised in the Channel Islands, and from the South-west Cancer Registry for MMs excised in the southwest of England and for NMSCs in both areas. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASRs) per 100,000 of the population in the Channel Islands were compared with those with the southwest of England, the UK and the rest of Europe where available. The MM characteristics of the Channel Islands were then compared with the southwest of England using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). RESULTS: The ASR/100,000 for  cutaneous MM for 2005-2009 was 30 for the Channel Islands (31.3 for Jersey, 28.2  for Guernsey), 20.3 for the southwest of England, and 15.6 for the UK. Comparison with the rest of Europe indicated that the incidence of MM in the Channel Islands is one of the highest in Europe. The highest incidence of MM was in the over 65 years age group on both Guernsey and Jersey, and when divided into 5-year age bands, the 70-74 years age group had the highest rate. This suggests that this particular age group may have previously received greater exposure to some environmental factor that promotes MM development. The ASR/100,000 for NMSC was also higher for the Channel Islands (263.3) than for the southwest of England (174.6) for 2005-2009, and for the UK in 2009 (104.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the Channel Islands have a high incidence of skin cancer (both MM  and NMSC).

Cells grown for more than 30 weeks in the presence of sublethal doses of CDT showed increased mutation frequency, and accumulation of chromatin and chromosomal aberrations in the absence of significant alterations of cell cycle distribution, decreased viability or senescence. Cell survival was dependent on sustained activity of the p38 MAP kinase. The ongoing genomic instability was associated with impaired activation of the DNA damage response and failure to efficiently activate cell cycle checkpoints upon exposure to genotoxic stress. Independently selected sublines showed enhanced anchorage-independent growth as assessed by the formation of colonies in semisolid agarose.

       " '22998595': {'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by tumour cells which have roles in paracrine signalling during tumour progression, including tumour-stromal interactions, activation of proliferative pathways and bestowing immunosuppression. Hypoxia is an important feature of solid tumours which promotes tumour progression, angiogenesis and metastasis, potentially through exosome-mediated signalling. METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines were cultured under either moderate (1% O2) or severe (0.1% O2) hypoxia. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting for the exosomal protein CD63 in order to assess the impact of hypoxia on exosome release. Hypoxic exosome fractions were assayed for miR-210 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and normalised to exogenous and endogenous control genes. Statistical significance was determined using the Student T test with a P value of < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Exposure of three different breast cancer cell lines to moderate (1% O2) and severe (0.1% O2) hypoxia resulted in significant increases in the number of exosomes present in the conditioned media as determined by NTA and CD63 immunoblotting. Activation of hypoxic signalling by dimethyloxalylglycine, a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylase inhibitor, resulted in significant increase in exosome release. Transfection of cells with HIF-1alpha siRNA prior to hypoxic exposure prevented the enhancement of exosome release by hypoxia. The hypoxically regulated miR-210 was identified to be present at elevated levels in  hypoxic exosome fractions. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that hypoxia  promotes the release of exosomes by breast cancer cells, and that this hypoxic response may be mediated by HIF-1alpha. Given an emerging role for tumour cell-derived exosomes in tumour progression, this has significant implications for understanding the hypoxic tumour phenotype, whereby hypoxic cancer cells may  release more exosomes into their microenvironment to promote their own survival and invasion.',\n",

Restoring wild-type (WT) p53 function is an attractive new therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer due to the well-described powerful tumor suppressor function of p53. As emerging evidence intimately links p53 and stem cell biology, this approach also provides an opportunity to target CSCs. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the therapeutic approaches to restore the function of WT p53, cancer and normal stem cell biology in relation to p53 and the downstream effects of p53 on CSCs. EXPERT OPINION: The restoration of WT p53 function by targeting p53 directly, its interacting proteins or its family members holds promise as a new class of cancer therapies.  This review examines the impact that such therapies may have on normal and CSCs based on the current evidence linking p53 signaling with these populations.',\n",

Here, we address the impact of nitric oxide (NO) on the induction of DNA damage and genome instability with a specific focus on the involvement of topoisomerase  II (TOP2). We also investigate the contribution of NO to the formation of skin melanoma in mice. RESULTS: Similar to the TOP2-targeting drug, etoposide (VP-16), the NO-donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), induces skin melanomas formation in 7,12-dimethyl- benz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mice. To explore the mechanism(s) underlying this NO-induced tumorigenesis, we use a co-culture model  system to demonstrate that inflamed macrophages with inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression cause gamma-H2AX activation, p53 phosphorylation, and chromosome DNA breaks in the target cells. Inhibitor experiments revealed that NO and TOP2 isozymes are responsible for the above described cellular phenotypes. Notably, NO, unlike VP-16, preferentially induces the formation of TOP2beta cleavable complexes (TOP2betacc) in cells. Moreover, GSNO induced TOP2-dependent DNA sequence rearrangements and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the incidences of GSNO- and VP-16-induced skin melanomas were also observed to be lower in the skin-specific top2beta-knockout mice. Our results suggest that TOP2 isozymes contribute to NO-induced mutagenesis and subsequent cancer development during chronic inflammation. INNOVATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first experimental evidence for the functional role of TOP2 in NO-caused DNA damage, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis. Notably, these studies contribute to our molecular understanding of the cancer-promoting actions of RNOS during chronic inflammation.',\n",

Steroid receptor RNA Activator (SRA) is a long, noncoding RNA coactivator (although some protein-encoding 5' splice variants have also been reported) that requires pseudouridylation by Pus1p to stimulate steroid receptor signaling. A uridine at position 206 (U206), which is  located in small hairpin structure STR5 in the conserved SRA core sequence, is a  critical target for pseudouridylation. We assessed if synthetic STR5 could serve  as a novel competitive inhibitor of ERalpha and AR signaling by disrupting the Pus1p-SRA-steroid receptor axis. STR5 specifically inhibited Pus1p-dependent pseudouridylation of SRA with higher efficiency than STR5 mutant U206A. We show that SRA binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of ERalpha and AR with high affinity despite the absence of a recognizable RNA binding motif (RBM). Finally,  we show that STR5 specifically inhibits ERalpha- and AR-dependent transactivation of target genes in steroid-sensitive cancer cells, consistent with disruption of  the targeted Pus1p-SRA pathway. Together, our results show that the NTD of ERalpha and AR contains a novel RBM that directly binds SRA, and that STR5 can serve as a novel class of RNA inhibitor of ERalpha and AR signaling by interfering with Pus1p-mediated SRA pseudouridylation. Targeting this unexplored  receptor signaling pathway may pave the way for the development of new types of cancer therapeutics.\",\n",

Previously, we demonstrated that prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) catalyzes the reduction of the PPARgamma ligand 15-keto-PGE(2) into 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE(2). Here, we present functional data and clinical relevance for the role of PTGR2 in gastric cancer. Using lentiviral technology in AGS and SNU-16 gastric cancer cell lines,  we either down-regulated or overexpressed PTGR2. In vitro analysis showed that PTGR2 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation rate and colony formation, and in vivo xenograft models showed slower growth of tumors. Mechanistically, PTGR2 knockdown induced cell death, altered mitochondrial function, and increased reactive oxygen species production, which led to activation of ERK1/2 and caspase 3, with increased Bcl-2 and suppressed Bax expression. PTGR2 overexpression showed the opposite outcomes. Clinically, immunopathological staining showed strong PTGR2 expression in the gastric tumor portion, relative to nearby nontumor portions, and its expression negatively correlated with survival of patients with intestinal-type gastric cancer. Finally, in contrast to PTGR2-overexpressing cells, PTGR2-knockdown cells were more sensitive to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Taken together, our findings not only provide functional and mechanistic evidence of the involvement of PTGR2 in gastric cancer, but also provide clinical observations affirming the significance of PTGR2 in gastric cancer and suggesting that PTGR2-target based therapy is worth further evaluation.',\n",

We sought to evaluate the combined effect of BRAF inhibition and TSH supplementation on (131)I uptake of BRAF(V600E)-mutant human thyroid cancer cells. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: WRO cells (a BRAF(V600E)-mutant follicular-derived papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line) were transfected with small interfering RNA targeting BRAF for 72 h in a physiological TSH environment. NIS and TSHr expression were then evaluated at three levels: gene expression, protein levels, and (131)I uptake. These three main outcomes were then reassessed in TSH-depleted media and media supplemented with supratherapeutic concentrations of TSH. RESULTS: NIS gene expression increased 5.5-fold 36 h after transfection (P = 0.01), and TSHr gene expression increased 2.8-fold at 24 h (P = 0.02). NIS and TSHr protein levels were similarly increased 48 and 24 h after transfection, respectively. Seventy-two hours after BRAF inhibition, (131)I uptake was unchanged in TSH-depleted media, increased by 7.5-fold (P < 0.01) in physiological TSH media,  and increased by 9.1-fold (P < 0.01) in supratherapeutic TSH media. CONCLUSIONS:  The combined strategy of BRAF inhibition and TSH supplementation results in greater (131)I uptake than when either technique is used alone.

METHODS: A case-control study with 880 colorectal cancer cases and 848 controls was conducted to investigate whether variations in the catalase (CAT) gene, one of the genes involved in scavenging oxidative stress, influenced susceptibility to CRC. RESULTS: The interaction between life style and genotypes as well as with their effects on colorectal cancer was deduced from the present study. Significant difference (P = 0.01) was identified in the distribution of CAT genotype between the colorectal cancer cases and the controls. The CRC cases had  significantly lower mean activity than the controls (P < 0.01). Correlation analyses revealed statistically significant correlations between CAT activity and CAT genotype (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The risk of CRC was associated with smoking, low vegetable consumption, high pork and poultry consumptions, and low or high BMI.

We investigated the value of the PCA3 (prostate cancer gene 3) urine test in predicting the likelihood of diagnosis of cancer before biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, community based clinical trial to evaluate PCA3 score before any biopsy. This trial was conducted at 50 urology  practices in the United States. Samples were obtained from 1,962 men with increased serum prostate specific antigen (greater than 2.5 ng/ml) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination before transrectal prostate needle biopsy. Study samples (urinary PCA3 and biopsies) were processed and analyzed by a central laboratory. Sensitivity-specificity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 1,913 urine samples (97.5%) were adequate for PCA3 testing. Of 802 cases diagnosed with prostate cancer 222 had high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation and were suspicious for cancer,  whereas 889 cases were benign. The traditional PCA3 cutoff of 35 reduced the number of false-positives from 1,089 to 249, a 77.1% reduction. However, false-negatives (missed cancers) increased significantly from 17 to 413, an increase of more than 2,300%. Lowering the PCA3 cutoff to 10 reduced the number of false-positives 35.4% and false-negatives only increased 5.6%.

RESULTS: Overall, 41 patients (31.5%) with biochemical recurrence experienced systemic progression and 57 (42.5%) died, including 19 (14.2%) of prostate cancer. Median systemic progression-free and cancer specific survival were not attained at 15 years of followup after biochemical recurrence. Median time from prostatectomy to recurrence was 3.3 years. Ten-year cancer specific survival was not significantly different for patients who experienced biochemical recurrence less and greater than 3.3 years after radical prostatectomy (83% and 83%, respectively, p = 0.39). Moreover, on multivariate analysis increased pathological Gleason score (HR 1.78, p = 0.02) and rapid prostate specific antigen doubling time (less than 6-month doubling time HR 11.39, p <0.0001) were significantly associated with the risk of systemic progression. CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation therapy is heterogeneous with only  a minority of these men experiencing systemic progression and death from prostate cancer. The decision to begin additional therapies in such patients must balance  the risk of disease progression, based on pathological Gleason score and postoperative prostate specific antigen doubling time, against the cost and morbidity of treatment.',\n",

Selective detection of prostate cancer with increased microvessel density is possible with contrast enhanced ultrasound. Preliminary studies suggest that pretreatment with a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor may improve the efficiency of contrast enhanced ultrasound targeted biopsy. This  study was designed to quantify prostate cancer detection with contrast enhanced ultrasound with or without short-term pretreatment with dutasteride. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of oral dutasteride pretreatment, contrast enhanced ultrasound findings were graded and used to direct targeted biopsy (up to 6 cores per prostate). A blinded 12-core systematic biopsy was subsequently performed on every subject based on standard medial and lateral sampling of each sextant. RESULTS: Of 311 subjects who underwent randomization, 272 completed participation. Positive biopsies were obtained in 276 of 3,264 (8.5%) systematic cores and 203 of 1,237 (16.4%) targeted cores (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.6, p <0.001). ROC analysis for the detection of all prostate cancers demonstrated an increase in diagnostic accuracy from pre-contrast imaging to contrast enhanced ultrasound (A(z) 0.60 vs 0.64, p = 0.005). For the detection of high grade cancer (Gleason score 7 or greater) ROC analysis demonstrated improved accuracy for pre-contrast imaging (A(z) 0.74) and  contrast enhanced ultrasound (A(z) 0.80, p = 0.0005). For the detection of high grade cancer with greater than 50% biopsy core involvement, excellent accuracy was demonstrated with pre-contrast and contrast enhanced ultrasound, A(z) 0.83 and 0.90, respectively (p = 0.001). Pretreatment with dutasteride had no significant impact on the detection of prostate cancer (p = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Contrast enhanced ultrasound targeted biopsy provides a significant benefit for the detection of high grade/high volume prostate cancer.',\n",

       " '22998919': {'AB': 'PURPOSE: The Gleason scoring system has been the traditional basis for studies on the assessment and treatment of prostate cancer. Recent reports of long-term prostate cancer outcomes stratified by Gleason score based on the 2005 ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) update suggest that important aspects of the biology of prostate cancer correlate with commonly available histopathological information. In this review we present a conceptual framework for the possible existence of distinct but interrelated developmental pathways in the context of the Gleason score in considering various biological and clinical aspects of prostate cancer. This may be useful in characterizing prostate cancer  as an indolent condition in some and an aggressive disease in others, in decision making for treatment, and in the interpretation of the biological course and treatment outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of clinical, pathological and investigational biological literature on this topic was conducted. In addition, the biological behavior of prostate cancer as interpreted from this survey was compared to that of other solid neoplasms in developing a schema for characterizing the pathogenesis of various forms of the disease. RESULTS: The Gleason scoring system has been found to have fundamental value in predicting the behavior of prostate cancer and assessing outcomes of its treatment. Increasingly, the proportion of Gleason pattern 4 in a prostatectomy specimen is being recognized as a critical factor in predicting the rates of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality. Under the current  Gleason classification, a Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 cancer carries a minimal long-term risk of progression or mortality. Risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality increases with increasing proportions of the Gleason 4  component in the prostatectomy specimen, from 3 + 3 = 6 with tertiary 4 (ie less  than 5% of a 4 component) to 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 3 = 7 and 4 + 4 = 8. Assuming that the Gleason 4 component increases in volume more rapidly with time than well differentiated components, it can be inferred that a smaller proportion of Gleason 4 could mean that the cancer has been identified at an earlier phase in the natural history of the disease. This could explain the improved prognosis on  the basis of length and lead time biases, and conceivably on the basis of a decreased likelihood of cancer cells having metastasized. Correspondingly, increasing amounts of Gleason 4 cancer in a prostate specimen might be explained  in 2 ways, as the preferential growth of a single clone of Gleason 4 cells, possibly with intraprostatic spread, or the evolution of Gleason 3 cancer cells to become Gleason 4. These hypotheses have been examined by genetic analysis of metastatic deposits and by comparisons of multiple foci of cancer within individual prostates. The clinical significance of these concepts in regard to disease status at diagnosis, treatment selection, outcomes of treatment, and implications for future research on the basis of clinical and molecular observations are the basis of the developmental schemata we propose. CONCLUSIONS: Given the relatively benign nature of homogeneous, low volume Gleason 3 tumors, and the progressive risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality with increasing quantities of Gleason 4 components, we propose that Gleason 4 (and 5) cancers constitute cancer diatheses distinct from that of Gleason 3 cancer. This distinction may contribute to the understanding of the prognosis intrinsic to these biological behavioral patterns, and help guide the translation of findings at molecular and histological levels to a more precise selection of treatments.',\n",

They  are characterized by a predominant muscle fibre necrosis and regeneration but with little or no associated inflammation. This histological pattern is observed  in acquired myopathy but also in muscular dystrophy. Acquired NM can be secondary to drugs or toxics, and if not, autoimmune mechanisms have to be suspected. Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy is recognized as a subgroup of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, different from other myositides. Generally, patients present a rapidly progressive and severe symmetrical proximal weakness with high  serum creatine kinase level, associated in some patients with cardiac involvement. On the other hand, a slower progression may sometimes be observed, that could lead to erroneous diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy may be associated to specific autoantibodies against signal recognition particle, or more recently described, against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Necrotizing auto-immune myopathy can also be described in association with connective tissue diseases such as lupus or sclerodermia. In remaining cases, cancer association may be observed.

Evolving topics in personalized oncology such as genomic analysis, targeted drugs, cancer therapeutics and molecular diagnostics will be discussed in this review. Biomarkers and molecular individualized medicine are replacing the traditional \"one size fits all\" medicine. In the next decade the treatment of cancer will move from a reactive to a proactive discipline. The essence of personalized oncology lies in the use of biomarkers. These biomarkers can be from tissue, serum, urine or imaging and must be validated. Personalized oncology based on biomarkers is already having a remarkable impact. Three different types  of biomarkers are of particular importance: predictive, prognostic and early response biomarkers. Tools for implementing preemptive medicine based on genetic  and molecular diagnostic and interventions will improve cancer prevention. Imaging technologies such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emitted Tomography (PET) are already influencing the early detection and management of the cancer patient. Future advances in imaging are expected to be in the field of molecular imaging, integrated diagnostics, biology driven interventional radiology and theranostics. Molecular diagnostics identify individual cancer patients who are more likely to respond positively to targeted chemotherapies. Molecular diagnostics include testing for genes, gene expression, proteins and metabolites. The use of companion molecular diagnostics is expected to grow significantly in the future and will be integrated into new cancer therapies a single (bundled) package which will provide greater efficiency, value and cost savings.

A novel score was retrospectively calculated assigning a grade to the clinical-laboratory findings at diagnosis. 0 and 1 point were respectively assigned to the normal or abnormal parameter. Two groups were identified: SCORE 0 and SCORE 1. RESULTS: Patients with cholangiocarcinoma or Klatskin tumours or asymptomatic at diagnosis presented a significantly better overall survival (OS)  than patients with different primary sites or who presented pain, jaundice or cholangitis. At univariate analysis, high levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and CA19-9 before surgery, hyperbilirubinemia before and after surgery had a negative correlation with OS. A worse OS was observed in patients with a higher score (median OS in the \"score 0\" group=30.79 months vs. median OS in the \"score 1\"=17.98 months).

Functionality of risk polymorphisms was evaluated through production of TNF-alpha in cell culture and Toll-like receptors levels quantified by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: TLR2+597CC homozygous had 5-fold decreased risk (odds  ratio (OR)=0.21, 95% CI: 0.09-0.50, p<0.001) and TLR4 299Gly homozygous 3-fold increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR=3.30, 95% CI: 1.18-9.28, p=0.015).

The objective of our study was to assess the results of a multidisciplinary care path for patients undergoing thoracic cancer surgery, using a concurrent integrated prospective database. METHODS: From April 2006 to December 2008, 169 eligible patients, admitted for thoracic cancer surgery in our institute, gave informed consent to participate in this prospective study. Detailed clinical data concerning patient-, tumour-, treatment- and outcome characteristics were collected. For evaluation of pain and quality of life (QoL), visual analogue scale (VAS) and SF-36 were used respectively. Information retrieved on 94 patients operated in the baseline period (until November 2007) was used in multidisciplinary consensus meetings to develop a new care path. After the introduction of this care path (January 2008) data-collection continued to evaluate outcome using the data of 75 patients operated in the evaluation period (until December 2008). RESULTS: Data from the baseline period showed age (p=0.001), indication (p=0.03), postoperative pain (p<0.001) and complications (p<0.001) to be independently related to length of stay (LOS). Subsequently, the  package of measures taken in the multidisciplinary care path were evaluated, showing significantly less postoperative pain (p=0.026) and a reduced length of hospital stay (p=0.014). In addition, a (trend towards) improvement in physical quality of life was observed 1 month (p=0.03) and 6 months (p=0.07) postoperatively.

The effective therapeutics for patients with advanced adrenocortical carcinoma(ACC) are greatly needed. The objective of this study was to identify and validate drugs with antineoplastic effect in ACC cells using a novel quantitative high-throughput drug screening (qHTS) technique. METHODS: A quantitative high-throughput proliferation assay of 2,816 clinically approved drugs was performed in the NCI-H295R ACC cell line. We validated the antiproliferative effect of candidate compounds in NCI-H295R cells. Further validation was performed in 3-dimensional multicellular aggregates (MCA) of NCI-H295R and SW-13  cell lines. RESULTS: We identified 79 active compounds against ACC cells; 21 had  an efficacy >/= 60% and IC50 <1 muM. The top drug categories enriched were cardiotonic, antiseptic, and antineoplastic. We selected Bortezomib, ouabain, Methotrexate, pyrimethamine for validation. All had an antiproliferative effect in monolayer culture of NCI-H295R cells at clinical achievable serum level. Bortezomib and ouabain inhibited growth of MCA in both cell lines at a low concentration (10 fold below IC50). Methotrexate inhibited growth and caused disintegration of MCA in both cell lines at concentrations well below the maximum serum level (10 to 100 fold of IC50). Pyrimethamine caused growth inhibition in both cell lines at 10 fold of IC50 concentration. CONCLUSIONS: qHTS of previously approved compounds is an effective and efficient method to identify anticancer drugs for a rare cancer such as ACC.

A conventional course of prostate radiotherapy consisting of four to five sessions a week, lasts between 7 and 8 weeks plus about one week  of preparation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific literature based on Pubmed, along with an exhaustive review of randomised studies presented at international congresses, have made it possible to analyse the numerous therapeutic regimens available other than the conventional normofractioned one (i.e. with doses per session ranging between 1.8 and 2.2 grays). RESULTS: Five randomised trials reported since 2005, plus several thousand patients treated by stereotaxic radiotherapy, have given rise to numerous scientific questions; these alternative hypofractioned courses (dose per fraction higher than 2.2 grays) have a potentially enhanced antitumoral efficacity along with the practical advantages of a shortened duration of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: The aim of this analysis of the scientific literature on hypofractioning in prostate cancer radiotherapy is to gather all the scientific evidence we currently have at our disposal. Further mature results of  future randomised trials will have to be examined before modifying current practice.',\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2010, 253 small renal masses were included in a retrospective study. Renal masses less than 3cm were compared to the 3 to 4cm masses. Clinical data, pathological data and follow-up was noted prospectively on the database and we analyzed it according to the treatment done (surgery, radiofrequency or observation). RESULTS: Surgical treatment, radiofrequency and observation were performed for 214 (86.4%), 15 (5.9%), and 24 (9.5%) patients respectively. The treatments of the patients differed in the two groups (<3cm vs. 3-4cm) and the appeal to radiofrequency and observation was more frequent for elder patients (>65years old) and for those whom performance status (ECOG status) greater or equal to 1. Cancer specific survival was not statistically different for the two groups (average: 87.5% after 5years, mean 33months follow-up, P=0.7). Independent risk factors of recurrence were Fuhrman grade, synchronous tumors, noddles invasion and metastatic progression. Positive surgical margins were not a risk factor of recurrence (P=0.6). CONCLUSION: Age and performance status are the two main clinical data, which influence the treatment for patients with small renal masses. Radiofrequency and observation were undertaken more regularly for elder and altered ones.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of 242 patients treated with RC and pelvic lymphadenectomy for UCB between January 2005  and June 2009. Different parameters were studied: age, PSAt, pathological stage of cystectomy specimen (pT and pN), tumor grade, number (nb) of nodes (N) in lymphadenectomy, nb of metastatic nodes (nb N+), bigger diameter of N+, ganglionic density, nb of N with capsular ruptur, associated CIS, associated prostate cancer, follow-up, global and specific survival, date and etiology of death. RESULTS: Positive STSM were identified in 22 patients (9.1%) and lymph node metastasis in 59 (24.4%). pN+ status was significantly associated with lower global (GS) and specific survival (SS) (P<0.003). So was it for patients with positive STSM R+ with actuarial 3-year GS and SS respectively of 5% and 25% versus 35% and 43.9% no STSM (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Positive soft tissue surgical margin and/or lymph node metatstasis on cystectomy specimen is a strong  predictor of GS and SS from urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.

RESULTS: The procedures were more often performed in private sector (up to 70%). There was a sustained increase (+332%) of the number of prostatectomies between 1997 and 2007 (more than 27,000 procedures), followed by a slight decrease. There is a rising use of laparoscopic approach from 35% in 2006 up to 58% in 2011. The use of brachytherapy and HIFU was marginal. Transurethral resection of the prostate number was stable between 56,000 and 60,000 procedures a year (for cancer for less than 7%). Adenomectomies number decreased from 9832 to 7963 procedures a year. CONCLUSION: The most noticeable data were upon prostatectomies number, with a peak effect in 2007.

The objective of this study was to analyze a group of patients who had a negative first BP for a PSA superior to 4 ng/mL and at least one additional PB and to compare these cases with controls who had the diagnosis PCa  from the first PB. METHODS: Retrospective single-center study comparing patients  with an elevated PSA and repeat biopsy following a first negative PB and patients with PCa diagnosed from the first PB. RESULTS: The 63 cases were younger than the 75 controls and had more often a normal digital rectal examination. Their prostate volume was larger and their number of PSA before the first PB lower: this corresponded to a lower PSA in the second (7/64), third (6/31), fourth (3/9) and sixth (1/1) PB. Among these cases with PCa, the length of core invaded by cancer and the total length of cancer of the entire PB were smaller than controls. In 76% of cases, the Gleason score among cases was 6 or less. CONCLUSION: PCa discovered on repeat biopsy had features of better prognosis than those of controls.

Our aim was to compare the impact of SLNB and ALND on QOL  and arm symptoms of patients with early breast cancer, using generic (short form  36 health survey) and tumor site-specific (FACT-B+4) instruments. METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal observational study of 93 patients (64 SLNB, 29 ALND). Patients were evaluated presurgery and 1, 6, and 12 months postsurgery. Generalized estimation equation models were constructed to assess the effect of treatment on QOL. The relative risks of edema, dysesthesia, and heaviness were calculated comparing ALND to SLND. RESULTS: Most patients presented T1 (67.7%) and underwent breast-conserving surgery (92.5%). At 12 months, the SLNB group presented deterioration on the FACT-B+4 Arm Scale (beta coefficient estimated a change of -1.6 score points; P < 0.01) while, compared with SLNB, the deterioration in the ALND group was almost 2 additional score points higher (P =  0.009). FACT-B+4 global summary and short form 36 health survey did not show statistically significant differences between groups. Relative risk of dysesthesia and subjective edema was higher for the ALND group than for the SLNB  group (1.97 and 2.11 at month 12; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results confirm the benefit of SLNB due to its lower arm morbidity impact on QOL, compared with ALND. There are clinically relevant between-treatment differences in the Arm Scale of FACT-B+4, while there were no relevant differences in general well-being, measured with the disease-specific FACT-B+4 and the generic short form 36 health survey.',\n",

METHODS: A total of 485 respondents including cancer patients and health care professionals (medical oncologists, nurses, and pharmacists) were surveyed by using a discrete  choice experiment in South Korea. Through a literature review and expert consultation, six attributes--progression-free survival, four adverse events (bone marrow suppression, hand-foot skin reaction, gastrointestinal perforation,  and bleeding), and administration--were selected. This study employed the conditional logit regression model. RESULTS: The six attributes are statistically significant for the patient group and health care professional group. The two groups, however, present differences in progression-free survival, hand-foot skin reaction, gastrointestinal perforation, and administration. The relative importance of adverse events is greater for the patient group, while that of efficacy and administration is greater for the health professional group.

Because of potential pitfalls of HGF exogenous administration, we investigated whether HGF serum concentration might be alternatively raised in vivo by administering low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). METHODS: The main HGF pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated following acute and chronic LMWH treatment. First, women, operated on for gynaecological tumors, were treated with a single dose of calcium nadroparin and studied for 12 hours. Next, women operated on for benign or malignant gynaecological tumors were treated daily with calcic nadroparin for one month. Subsequently, the biological activity of the measured HGF serum levels was tested in assays of ovarian cancer cell sensitization to drugs. RESULTS: In the short-term treated group, median HGF AUCss, Cmax and Caverage were about four-fold that of the control group, whereas Cmin was three-fold. In the patients treated chronically median HGF serum levels rose about six-fold in the first week, and decreased but remained significantly higher after one month. The pharmacokinetic of nadroparin-dependent HGF increase were similar in the two groups. The HGF concentrations measured after both acute and chronic treatment were found to be effective in sensitising ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. CONCLUSIONS: This study raises the possibility of using LMWH to increase HGF serum concentration and to take advantage of its biological activities. In particular, nadroparin might be used as a chemo-potentiating agent in epithelial cell ovarian carcinoma through its action on HGF serum concentration.

This paper uses in-depth interviews with 76 parents of pediatric cancer patients  to examine network ties among experientially similar others after a serious medical diagnosis. Interviews were conducted between August 2009 and May 2011. Findings demonstrate that many parents formed ties with other families experiencing pediatric cancer, and that information and resources were exchanged  during the everyday activities associated with their child's care. Network flows  contained emotional support, caregiving strategies, information about second opinions, health-related knowledge, and strategies for navigating the health care system. Diffusion of information, resources, and support occurred through explicit processes (direct information and support exchanges) and implicit processes (parents learning through observing other families). Network flows among parents shaped parents' perceptions of the health care experience and their role in their child's care.

Those with abnormal cytology underwent colposcopy, biopsy, and HPV testing. HPV was typed by flow-through hybridization on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. RESULTS: Among 6339 women examined, 533 with abnormal cytology underwent HPV testing. The  prevalence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) subtypes was 29.8%. HPV-16 was the most common genotype (12.8%), followed by HPV-33, HPV-58, HPV-66, HPV-18, and HPV-52.

RESULTS: Fifty-six patients - 31 male and 25 female patients - who underwent orbital exenteration between 2000 to 2009 were included in the study. The mean age was 62.5 years at the time of exenteration. Average follow-up was 23 months. The principal diagnoses were basal cell carcinoma of the eyelids (25%) and conjunctival melanoma (20%). For orbital reconstruction, 18 patients (32%) had a  muscle flap, and 24 patients (43%) underwent secondary reconstruction by bone-anchored implants after spontaneous epithelialisation of the orbit. Approximately 50% of the patients received postoperative radiation therapy. DISCUSSION: Surgical reconstruction using muscle flaps may mask recurrent tumor.  Epithelialisation and bone-anchored implants supporting the prosthesis allow for  recurrent cancer surveillance while providing better stabilization of the prosthesis. Radiation therapy seems to render the orbit more fragile and thus less stable for implants. CONCLUSION: Orbital exenteration is a mutilating technique.

Injecting a spacer  between Denonvilliers' fascia increases the distance between the prostate and the anterior rectal wall and may thus decrease the rectal radiation-induced toxicity. We assessed the dosimetric impact of this spacer with advanced delivery RT techniques, including intensity modulated RT (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and intensity modulated proton beam RT (IMPT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight prostate cancer patients were simulated for RT with or without spacer. Plans were computed for IMRT, VMAT, and IMPT using the Eclipse treatment  planning system using both computed tomography spacer+ and spacer- data sets. Prostate +/- seminal vesicle planning target volume [PTV] and organs at risk (OARs) dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using dose and volume metrics for comparative planning. RESULTS: Regardless of the radiation technique, spacer injection decreased significantly the rectal dose in  the 60- to 70-Gy range. Mean V(70 Gy) and V(60 Gy) with IMRT, VMAT, and IMPT planning were 5.3 +/- 3.3%/13.9 +/- 10.0%, 3.9 +/- 3.2%/9.7 +/- 5.7%, and 5.0 +/- 3.5%/9.5 +/- 4.7% after spacer injection. Before spacer administration, the corresponding values were 9.8 +/- 5.4% (P=.012)/24.8 +/- 7.8% (P=.012), 10.1 +/-  3.0% (P=.002)/17.9 +/- 3.9% (P=.003), and 9.7 +/- 2.6% (P=.003)/14.7% +/- 2.7% (P=.003).

With this technique, mean V(70.2 Gy) (P=.07) and V(74.1 Gy) (P=0.03) were 100 +/- 0% to 99.8 +/- 0.2% and 99.1 +/- 1.2% to 95.8 +/- 4.6% with and without Spacer, respectively. As a result of spacer injection, bladder doses were usually higher but not significantly so. Only IMPT managed to decrease the rectal dose after spacer injection for all dose levels, generally with no observed increase to the bladder dose. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the radiation technique, a substantial decrease of rectal dose was observed after spacer injection for curative RT to the prostate.\",\n",

We examined the safety and benefits of PEG placement in  this population at our institution. STUDY DESIGN: A 5-year retrospective review of patients with malignancy (excluding head/neck and thoracic malignancy) who underwent PEG at our institution was performed. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-nine patients with malignancy underwent PEG; 33.9% had hematologic malignancy, 66.1% had nonhematologic malignancy, and 44.4% had metastatic disease. Indications for PEG were enteral access (73%) and gastric decompression/management of obstructive symptoms (27%). Few patients achieved independence from total parenteral nutrition (22%) or diet advancement (24.6%). Overall rates of major complications (eg, aspiration, tube dislodgement/leakage,  bleeding, visceral injury, respiratory failure after procedure, and cardiac arrest) and minor complications (eg, superficial infection and ileus) were 10.2%  and 11.3%, respectively. All-cause in-hospital mortality was high (19.6%) and was associated with ICU admission (p = 0.018), earlier bone marrow transplantation (p = 0.022), steroid treatment (p = 0.024), and lower preoperative albumin (p = 0.003). Code status was changed after PEG in 44 patients from full code to DNR/do no intubate or comfort measures only. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement in this study population was associated with major procedure-related complications. The majority of patients failed to achieve total parenteral nutrition independence or advancement of diet. Nearly 25% of patients  declined aggressive resuscitation strategies after undergoing surgery for PEG. This study cautions to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of PEG placement in this patient population.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed 104 consecutive surgical patients (47 males, 57 females, median age at PET/CT scan of 67.92 years) with diagnosed stage I to IV NSCLC who had baseline (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans. The (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed in accordance with National Cancer Institute guidelines. The MTV of tumors in the whole body (MTV(WB)), TLG of tumors in the whole body (TLG(WB)), the maximum standardized uptake value of tumors in the whole body (SUV(maxWB)) as well as the mean standardized uptake value of tumor in the whole body (SUV(meanWB)) were measured. The median follow-up among 67 survivors was 42.07 months from the PET/CT (range 2.82-80.95 months). Statistical methods included Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression, and C-statistics. The interobserver variability of SUV(maxWB), SUV(meanWB), MTV(WB), and TLG(WB) between two observers was analyzed using concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs). RESULTS: The interobserver variability of SUV(maxWB), SUV(meanWB), MTV(WB) and TLG(WB) was very low with CCCs greater than 0.882. There was a statistically significant association of stage with overall survival (OS). The hazard ratio (HR) of stage III and stage IV as compared with stage I was 3.60 (P = .001) and 4.00 (P = .013), respectively. The MTV(WB) was significantly associated with OS with a HR for 1-unit increase of ln(MTV(WB)) of 1.40/1.32 (P = .004/.039), before/after adjusting for stage and other prognostic factors including chemoradiation therapy, and surgical procedure, respectively. TLG(WB) had a statistically significant association with OS before and after adjusting for stage and the other prognostic factors. The HR for 1-unit increase in ln(TLG(WB)) was 1.26 (P = .011) and 1.25 (P = .031), before and after the adjustment, respectively. Subjects with conditions that led to pneumonectomy (HR = 2.82, P =  .035) or segmental resection (HR = 3.44, P = .044) had significantly worse survival than those needing lobectomy. There was no statistically significant association between OS and age, gender, tumor histology, ln(SUV(maxWB)), and ln(SUV(meanWB)) (all P > .05). There were 37 deaths during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Baseline whole-body metabolic tumor burden as measured with MTV(WB) and TLG(WB) on FDG PET is a prognostic measure independent of clinical stage and other prognostic factors including chemoradiation therapy and surgical procedure with low interobserver variability and may be used to further risk stratify surgical patients with NSCLC. This study also suggests that MTV and TLG are better prognostic measures than SUV(max) and SUV(mean). These results will need to be validated in larger cohorts in a prospective study.',\n",

Combining these  agents in pre-treated patients with metastatic disease had previously proved challenging, so the primary objective of this study aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in treatment-naive patients, by identifying acute dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during cycle 1 in the first part of a phases 1-2 neoadjuvant European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with large operable or locally-advanced HER2 positive breast cancer were treated with continuous lapatinib, and docetaxel every 21days for 4 cycles. Dose levels (DLs) were: 1000/75, 1250/75, 1000/85, 1250/85, 1000/100 and 1250/100 (mg/day)/(mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included. Two DLTs occurred at dose level 5 (1000/100); one grade 4 neutropenia >/= 7days and one febrile neutropenia. A further 3 patients were therefore treated at the same dose with prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and 3 patients at dose level 6. No further DLTs were  observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our recommended dose for phase II is lapatinib 1000mg/day  and docetaxel 100mg/m(2) with G-CSF in HER2 positive non-metastatic breast cancer. The dose of lapatinib should have been 1250mg/day but we were mindful of  the high rate of treatment discontinuation in GeparQuinto with lapatinib 1250mg/day combined with docetaxel. No grade 3-4 diarrhoea was observed. Pharmacodynamics analysis suggests that concomitant medications altering P-glycoprotein activity (in addition to lapatinib) can modify toxicity, including non-haematological toxicities. This needs verification in larger trials, where it may contribute to understanding the sources of variability in clinical toxicity and treatment discontinuation.',\n",

In order to investigate the possible role of miRNAs in the development of multi-drug resistance (MDR) in human glioblastoma, we first detected (by Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] and immunohistochemistry) the expression of miR-296-3p and ether-a-go-go (EAG1 or KCNH1) in U251 cells, U251/imatinib mesylate (U251AR cells) and clinical specimens. The results showed  that miR-296-3p was down-regulated in U251AR cells, concurrent with the up-regulation of EAG1 protein, compared with the parental U251 cell line. In vitro drug sensitivity assay demonstrated that over-expression of miR-296-3p sensitised glioblastoma (GBM) cells to anticancer drugs, whereas down-expression  using antisense oligonucleotides conferred MDR. Ectopic expression of miR-296-3p  reduced EAG1 expression and suppressed cell proliferation drug resistance, and the luciferase activity of an EAG1 3'-untranslated region-based reporter construct in U251AR cells, whereas EAG1 over-expression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-296-3p in U251AR cells. We also found that EAG1 was widely over-expressed and inversely correlated with miR-296-3p in clinical specimens.

They are often co-expressed in multiple human tumors and related cancer cell lines what can indicate that the ghrelin/GHS-R axis may have  an important role in tumor growth and progression. However, a role of ghrelin in  canine tumors remains unknown. Thus, the aim of our study was two-fold: (1) to assess expression of ghrelin and its receptor in canine mammary cancer and (2) to examine the effect of ghrelin on carcinoma cells proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. The expression of ghrelin and its receptor in canine mammary cancer tissues and cell lines (isolated from primary tumors and their metastases) was examined using Real-time qPCR and immunohistochemistry. For apoptosis analysis the Annexin V and propidium iodide dual staining was applied whereas cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay and BrdU incorporation test. The influence of ghrelin on cancer cells migration and invasion was assessed using Boyden chamber assays and wound healing assay. RESULTS: The highest expression of ghrelin was observed in metastatic cancers whereas the lowest expression of ghrelin receptor was detected in tumors of the 3rd grade of  malignancy. Higher expression of ghrelin and its receptor was detected in cancer  cell lines isolated from metastases than in cell lines isolated from primary tumors. In vitro experiments demonstrated that exposure to low doses of ghrelin stimulates cellular proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and promotes motility and invasion of canine mammary cancer cells. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor inhibitor ([D-Lys3]-GHRP6) as well as RNA interference enhances early apoptosis.  CONCLUSION: The presence of ghrelin and GHS-R in all of the examined canine mammary tumors may indicate their biological role in cancer growth and development.

Its expression and clinical value of prognostic prediction for gastric cancer (GC) is unclear. METHODS: CENP-H and Ki-67 expressions in specimens from 166 patients with GC were determined by tissue microarrays and immunostaining. Their correlations between patients' clinicopathologic features and prognosis were explored. For mechanisms, quantitative CENP-H examination on gastric cancer tissue and cell lines was performed via real-time quantitative PCR and Western Blot. Its effect on Survivin expression and cell function was evaluated via CENP-H knocking down (SiRNA) or overexpression. RESULTS: Highly expression of CENP-H was found in 85 of 166 GC, showing a significant correlation with tumour size, depth of infiltration, lymph  node metastasis, distant metastasis and UICC staging of gastric carcinoma (P < 0.05), as well as clinical prognosis (coefficient = 0.550, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that combined CENP-H and Ki67 expression was a more valuable independent prognostic predictor for patients' survival (hazard ratio, 2.18; P = 0.0109). Furthermore, total mRNA and protein expression of CENP-H in GC tissue and cell lines were noticeably increased. Survivin expression and cell function including growth, proliferation and clonogenic ability could be inhibited by CENP-H siRNA or enhanced by overexpressing CENP-H. CONCLUSION: High  expression of CENP-H in GC indicates poor prognosis and Survivin may mediate its  procancer role.

METHODS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, we identified men (aged >/= 66 years) treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer who had been diagnosed from 2001 to 2007. Using data from the American Health Planning Association, we sorted the health service areas (HSAs) according to the stringency of certificate of need regulations (low vs high) in that market. We assessed our outcomes (ie, the probability of intensity-modulated radiotherapy adoption and intensity-modulated radiotherapy use in the HSAs) using Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regression models, respectively. RESULTS: The low- and high-stringency markets were similar in terms of racial composition (80% vs 85% white, P = .08), population density (1085 vs 558 people/square mile, P = .08), and income (median $38 683 vs $40 309, P = .44). However, the low-stringency markets had more patients with stage T1 disease (45% vs 36%, P < .01).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1990 to 2010, 80 patients with T2-T4 bladder cancer were prospectively enrolled in 2 successive bladder-sparing protocols. Forty-one patients were treated with neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine (MCV) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) in complete responders (protocol 1 [P1]) and 39 patients were treated with weekly cisplatin concurrent with radiotherapy (64.8 Gy) (protocol 2 [P2]). RESULTS: The  median follow-up was 72 months (range, 9-204 months). Five and 10-year cumulative overall survival for all series were 73% and 60% and the corresponding numbers for cancer-specific survival were 82% and 80%, respectively. Of all surviving patients, 83% maintained their own bladder. Although there were no significant differences in overall survival (P = .820), cancer-specific survival (P = .688) and distant metastasis (P = .417) between protocols, complete response rates (P = .003), and disease-free survival (P = .031) were significantly higher in P2 treatment.

In this study, a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based bilayer hydrogel system that not only supports the tumoroid formation from LNCaP prostate cancer (PCa) cells, but also  simulates their reciprocal interactions with the tumor-associated stroma was developed and characterized. HA hydrogels were prepared by mixing solutions of HA precursors functionalized with acrylate groups (HA-AC) and reactive thiols (HA-SH) under physiological conditions. The resultant viscoelastic gels have an average elastic modulus of 234 +/- 30 Pa and can be degraded readily by hyaluronidase. The orthogonal and cytocompatible nature of the crosslinking chemistry permits facile incorporation of cytokine-releasing particles and PCa cells. In our bilayer hydrogel construct, the top layer contains heparin (HP)-decorated, HA-based hydrogel particles (HGPs) capable of releasing heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in a sustained manner at a rate of 2.5 wt%/day cumulatively. LNCaP cells embedded in the bottom layer receive the growth factor signals from the top, and in response  form enlarging tumoroids with an average diameter of 85 mum by day 7. Cells in 3D hydrogels assemble into spherical tumoroids, form close cellular contacts through E-cadherin, and show cortical organization of F-actin, whereas those plated as 2D monolayers adopt a spread-out morphology. Compared to cells cultured on 2D, the engineered tumoroids significantly increased the expression of two pro-angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF(165)) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), both at mRNA and protein levels. Overall, the HA model system provides a  useful platform for the study of tumor cell responses to growth factors and for screening of anticancer drugs targeting these pathways.',\n",

We used the ACE-1 prostate tumor model and evaluated the feasibility of treating prostate tumors with histotripsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 immunosuppressed (cyclosporine treated) canine subjects received transrectal ultrasound guided percutaneous intraprostatic injection of ACE-1 canine prostate cancer cells. Prostates were serially imaged with transrectal ultrasound to monitor tumor growth. Subjects were sham treated (3) or underwent transabdominal histotripsy of the prostate, which targeted implanted tumor and adjacent parenchyma using a 750  kHz piezoelectric ultrasound therapy transducer. Prostates were examined histologically to confirm tumor and the histotripsy treatment effect. RESULTS: ACE-1 tumors were visualized on transrectal ultrasound in all 10 subjects within  2 weeks of tumor injection. Lesions demonstrated growth in the prostatic capsule, glandular lobules, fibrous septa and periurethral stroma with significant desmoplastic reaction and areas of central necrosis on histology. Lymph node and/or pulmonary metastases developed in 4 subjects. Ultrasound tumor localization and initiation of cavitation during histotripsy therapy were feasible in all treated subjects. Histologically there was evidence of homogenization of tumor and prostatic parenchyma in all 4 acute subjects with necrosis and hemorrhage in the 3 chronic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows  the feasibility of histotripsy destruction of prostate tumors in a canine ACE-1 model. It suggests a potential role for histotripsy based focal therapy for prostate cancer. Further studies are needed to better characterize the effects of histotripsy on malignant tissues.',\n",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative spatial relationship between 4DCT and hyperpolarized (3)He MRI ventilation maps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with lung cancer provided written informed consent to 4DCT imaging and MRI performed within 11 +/- 14 days. Hyperpolarized (3)He MRI was acquired in breath-hold after inhalation from functional residual capacity of 1 L hyperpolarized (3)He, whereas 4DCT imaging was acquired over a single tidal breath of room air. For hyperpolarized (3)He MRI, the percentage ventilated volume was generated using semiautomated segmentation; for 4DCT imaging, pulmonary function maps were generated using the correspondence between  identical tissue elements at inspiratory and expiratory phases to generate percentage ventilated volume. RESULTS: After accounting for differences in image  acquisition lung volumes ((3)He MRI: 1.9 +/- 0.5 L ipsilateral, 2.3 +/- 0.7 L contralateral; 4DCT imaging: 1.2 +/- 0.3 L ipsilateral, 1.3 +/- 0.4 L contralateral), there was no significant difference in percentage ventilated volume between hyperpolarized (3)He MRI (72 +/- 11% ipsilateral, 79 +/- 12% contralateral) and 4DCT imaging (74 +/- 3% ipsilateral, 75 +/- 4% contralateral). Spatial correspondence between 4DCT and (3)He MRI ventilation was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient index (ipsilateral, 86 +/- 12%; contralateral, 88 +/- 12%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite rather large differences in image acquisition breathing maneuvers, good spatial and significant quantitative agreement was observed for ventilation maps on hyperpolarized (3)He MRI and 4DCT imaging, suggesting that pulmonary regions with good lung function are similar between modalities in this small group of patients with lung cancer.',\n",

This study retrospectively investigated recent MRSA-related infections focusing on the relationship between  clinical risk factors and anti-MRSA drug resistance. The patients with MRSA-related infections in Kobe University Hospital (Kobe, Japan) in 2009 were enrolled in the study. The relationships between various clinical risk factors as well as MRSA bacterial DNA concentration with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of anti-MRSA drugs were examined. In total, 44 patients were enrolled in the study and MRSA was isolated from blood (23 patients), urine (12 patients) and nasal secretions (9 patients). There was only one resistant strain to linezolid (LZD) among the anti-MRSA drugs tested, and this strain was considered staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IIa from phage open-reading  frame typing analyses. Statistical analyses showed that MRSA bacterial DNA concentration, cancer and use of a respirator, respectively, had a significant relationship with the MICs of LZD (P=0.0058) and arbekacin (ABK) (P=0.0003), of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) (P=0.0500) and ABK (P=0.0133), and of Q/D (P=0.0198) and vancomycin (P=0.0036). In conclusion, bacterial DNA concentration, cancer and use of a respirator were found to be significant risk factors for lower susceptibilities to anti-MRSA drugs; one strain was resistant to LZD.

DESIGN: Laboratory study using human tissues. SETTING: Academic hospital. PATIENT(S): Twenty patients (cases) with histologically confirmed adenomyosis and 10 (controls) with leiomyomas, cervical  dysplasia, and cancer but no adenomyosis or endometriosis. INTERVENTION(S): Dysmenorrhea severity was scored by Visual Analog Scale. Uterine tissue samples were collected during hysterectomy.

In support, IL-10 released from TAM could stimulate cancer cell expression of membrane bound B7-H3. Furthermore, Lung cancer and TAM-related B7-H3 was identified as a strong inhibitor of T-cell effect and influenced the outcome of T cell immune response. In conclusion, TAM-tumor cell interaction-induced membrane-bound B7-H3 represents a novel immune escape mechanism which links the pro-inflammatory response to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu.',\n",

       " '22999864': {'AB': 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the  liver, accounting for 80%-90% of all liver cancers. The disease ranks as the fifth most common cancer worldwide and is the third leading cause of all cancer-associated deaths. Although advances in HCC detection and treatment have increased the likelihood of a cure at early stages of the disease, HCC remains largely incurable because of late presentation and tumor recurrence. Only 25% of  HCC patients are deemed suitable for curative treatment, with the overall survival at just a few months for inoperable patients. Apart from surgical resection, loco-regional ablation and liver transplantation, current treatment protocols include conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. But due to the highly resistant nature of the disease, the efficacy of the latter regimen is limited. The recent emergence of the cancer stem cell (CSC) concept lends insight into the explanation of why treatment with chemotherapy often may seem to be initially successful but results in not only a failure to eradicate the tumor but also possibly tumor relapse. Commonly used anti-cancer drugs in HCC work by targeting  the rapidly proliferating and differentiated liver cancer cells that constitute the bulk of the tumor. However, a subset of CSCs exists within the tumor, which are more resistant and are able to survive and maintain residence after treatment, thus, growing and self-renewing to generate the development and spread of recurrent tumors in HCC. In the past few years, compelling evidence has emerged in support of the hierarchic CSC model for solid tumors, including HCC. And in particular, CD133 has drawn significant attention as a critical liver CSC  marker. Understanding the characteristics and function of CD133(+) liver CSCs has also shed light on HCC management and treatment, including the implications for prognosis, prediction and treatment resistance. In this review, a detailed summary of the recent progress in CD133(+) liver CSC research with regard to identification, regulation and clinical implications will be discussed.',\n",

It  is important, in terms of the validity of these studies, to have accurate cause of death information. However, it is well documented that cause of death information taken from death certificates is often lacking in accuracy and completeness. METHODS: We assess through use of a simulation study the effect of  under and over-recording of cancer on death certificates in a competing risks analysis consisting of three competing causes of death: cancer, heart disease and other causes. Using realistic levels of misclassification, we consider 24 scenarios and examine the bias in the cause-specific hazard ratios and the cumulative incidence function. RESULTS: The bias in the cumulative incidence function was highest in the oldest age group reaching values as high as 2.6 percentage units for the \"good\" cancer prognosis scenario and 9.7 percentage units for the \"poor\" prognosis scenario. CONCLUSION: The bias resulting from the  chosen levels of misclassification in this study accentuate concerns that unreliable cause of death information may be providing misleading results.

We have recently shown that these compounds prevent tumor growth and sensitize resistant cancer cells to apoptosis by blocking the MEK-ERK-eIF4 pathway. However, their direct molecular target(s) remain(s) unknown. In this study, using an affinity chromatography approach we discovered that prohibitin (PHB) 1 and 2 are the direct targets of rocaglamides. Binding of rocaglamides to PHB prevents interaction between PHB and CRaf and, thereby, inhibits CRaf activation and subsequently CRaf-MEK-ERK signaling. Moreover, knockdown of PHB mimicked the effects of rocaglamides on the CRaf-MEK-ERK pathway and cell cycle progression. Thus, our finding suggests that  rocaglamides are a new type of anticancer agent and that they may serve as a small-molecular tool for studying PHB-mediated cellular processes.',\n",

METHODS: Acoustic radiation force impulse was performed on 95 patients with 122 BI-RADS 4 breast lesions diagnosed by conventional ultrasound. We calculated the area ratio of lesions by using virtual touch tissue imaging and gray-scale imaging. By using virtual touch tissue quantification, we calculated the ratio of shear wave velocity (SWV) in lesions and in surrounding glandular tissue at the same depth (SWV ratio). RESULTS: The mean area ratio of benign lesions (1.09 +/- 0.17) differed from that of the malignant lesions (1.96 +/- 0.64; P < .001). The mean SWV ratio of benign lesions (2.44 +/- 1.27) was lower than that of malignant lesions (5.74 +/- 1.68; P < .001). The cutoff for the area and SWV ratios for malignancy were estimated to be 1.37 and 3.65, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Acoustic radiation force impulse provides quantitative elasticity measurements, which, combined with conventional ultrasound, can potentially improve the diagnostic accuracy of BI-RADS 4 breast lesions, and it is helpful to regulate the BI-RADS classification and avoid the need for unnecessary biopsies.',\n",

In the brain, the gene is transcribed within the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Kisspeptin-13, one of the endogenous isoforms, consists of 13 amino acids. In this work, antidepressant-like effects of kisspeptin-13 were studied and the potential involvement of the adrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic  and gabaergic receptors in its antidepressant-like effects was investigated in a  modified forced swimming test (FST) in mice. The mice were pretreated with a nonselective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, an alpha(1)/alpha(2beta)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin, an alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, yohimbine, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol, a mixed 5-HT(1)/5-HT(2) serotonergic receptor antagonist, methysergide, a nonselective 5-HT(2) serotonergic receptor antagonist, cyproheptadine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, atropine, a D(2),D(3),D(4) dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, or a gamma-aminobutyric acid subunit A receptor antagonist, bicuculline. The FST  revealed that kisspeptin-13 reversed the immobility, climbing and swimming times, suggesting antidepressant-like effects. Phenoxybenzamine, yohimbine and cyproheptadine prevented the effects of kisspeptin-13 on the immobility, climbing and swimming times, whereas prazosin, propranolol, methysergide, atropine, haloperidol and bicuculline did not modify the effects of kisspeptin-13. The results demonstrated that the antidepressant-like effects of kisspeptin-13 in a modified mouse FST are mediated, at least in part, by an interaction of the alpha(2)-adrenergic and 5-HT(2) serotonergic receptors.',\n",

TET1 depletion facilitates cell invasion, tumor growth, and cancer metastasis in prostate xenograft models and correlates with poor survival rates in breast cancer patients. Consistently, enforced expression of TET1 reduces cell invasion  and breast xenograft tumor formation. Mechanistically, TET1 suppresses cell invasion through its dioxygenase and DNA binding activities. Furthermore, TET1 maintains the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) family  proteins 2 and 3 by inhibiting their DNA methylation.

This article presents a pilot study in housecats with unresectable liver cancer. Feasibility and tolerability of intratumoral administrations of (166)Ho-AcAc-MS was investigated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three cats with unresectable liver tumors of different histotype were  included. One cat had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one had cholangiocarcinoma  (CC), and one had a malignant epithelial liver tumor (MELT) of unspecified histotype. (166)Ho-AcAc-MS were injected percutaneously under ultrasound guidance into the tumors. Followup consisted of physical examinations and hematologic and  biochemical analyses. RESULTS: (166)Ho-AcAc-MS were administered to three liver tumor-bearing cats. The treatment was well tolerated and the clinical condition,  that is body weight, alertness, mobility, and coat condition of the animals improved markedly. Most biochemical and hematologic parameters normalized shortly after treatment. Life of all cats was extended and associated with a good quality of life. The HCC cat that received 33-Gy tumor-absorbed dose was euthanized 6 months after the first administration owing to disease progression. The MELT cat  received 99-Gy tumor dose and was euthanized 3 months posttreatment owing to bacterial meningitis. The CC cat received 333Gy and succumbed 4 months after the  first treatment owing to the formation of a pulmonary embolism.

A quantitative methylation specific polymerase  chain reaction assay panel, including GSTP1, APC and RASSF1, could increase the sensitivity of detecting cancer over that of pathological review alone, leading to a high negative predictive value and a decrease in unnecessary repeat biopsies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MATLOC study blindly tested archived prostate biopsy needle core tissue samples of 498 subjects from the United Kingdom and Belgium with histopathologically negative prostate biopsies, followed by positive (cases) or negative (controls) repeat biopsy within 30 months. Clinical performance of the epigenetic marker panel, emphasizing negative predictive value, was assessed and cross-validated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate all risk factors. RESULTS: The epigenetic assay performed on the first negative biopsies of this retrospective review cohort resulted in a negative predictive value of 90% (95% CI 87-93). In a multivariate  model correcting for patient age, prostate specific antigen, digital rectal examination and first biopsy histopathological characteristics the epigenetic assay was a significant independent predictor of patient outcome (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.81-5.53). CONCLUSIONS: A multiplex quantitative methylation specific polymerase chain reaction assay determining the methylation status of GSTP1, APC and RASSF1  was strongly associated with repeat biopsy outcome up to 30 months after initial  negative biopsy in men with suspicion of prostate cancer.

       " '23000059': {'AB': 'The estrogen receptor (ER) plays a cardinal role in estrogen-responsive breast carcinogenesis. It is, however, unclear as to how estrogen-ER interaction potentiates breast cancer progression. Compelling evidence supports estrogen-induced redox alterations, such as augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, as having a crucial role in breast carcinogenesis. Despite ER being a biological mediator of the majority of estrogen-induced cellular responses; its role in estrogen-induced tissue-specific ROS generation remains largely debatable. We examined a panel of human breast cancer specimens and found that ER-positive breast cancer specimens exhibited a higher incidence of augmented O(2)(*-) levels compared to matched normal tissue. ROS are known to function as signal transducers and ROS-mediated signaling remains a key complementary mechanism that drives carcinogenesis by activating redox-sensitive oncogenic pathways. Additional studies revealed that augmented O(2)(*-) levels in breast cancer specimens coincided with mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)  hyperactivation. Detailed investigations using in vitro experiments established that 17beta-estradiol (E2)-stimulated breast cancer cells exhibited transiently upregulated O(2)(*-) levels, with the presence of ER being a crucial determinant  for the phenomenon to take place. Gene expression, ER transactivation, and confocal studies revealed that the E2-induced transient O(2)(*-) upregulation was effected by ER through a nongenomic pathway possibly involving mitochondria. Furthermore, E2 treatment activated mTORC2 in breast cancer cells in a characteristically ER-dependent manner. Interestingly, altering O(2)(*-) anion levels through chemical/genetic methods caused significant modulation of the mTORC2 signaling cascade. Taken together, our findings unravel a novel nongenomic pathway unique to estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells wherein, upon stimulation by E2, ER may regulate mTORC2 activity in a redox-dependent manner by transiently modulating O(2)(*-) levels particularly within mitochondria. The findings suggest that therapies aimed at counteracting these redox alterations and/or resultant signaling cascades may complement conventional treatments for estrogen-responsive breast cancer.',\n",

METHODS: Databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for relevant original articles published from January 2000 to February 2012. We determined sensitivities and specificities across studies, calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and constructed summary receiver operating characteristic curves using hierarchical regression models. RESULTS: Across 11 studies (537 patients), DW-MRI sensitivity was 0.87 (95%confidence interval (CI), 0.80, 0.91) and specificity was 0.90 (95%CI, 0.86, 0.93). Overall, LR+ was 8.52 (95%CI, 6.17, 11.77), LR- was 0.15 (95%CI, 0.10, 0.22) and DOR was 57.36 (95%CI, 38.29, 85.93). In studies in which both DW-MRI and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) were  performed, the comparison of DW-MRI performance with that of CE-MRI suggested no  major differences against these two methods (p>0.05). DW-MRI combined CE-MRI had  higher sensitivity and specificity than DW-MRI alone (97% versus 86% and 91% versus 90%, respectively) (p<0.05). The subgroup in which DW-MRI examinations were performed with a 3.0 Tesla (T) device had higher pooled specificity (0.91, 95%CI, 0.88-0.95) than the subgroup of DW-MRI with 1.5 T device (0.81, 95%CI, 0.67, 0.94) (p<0.05). Average lesion size (</= 1.5 cm versus >1.5cm) did not influence the diagnostic accuracy of the test (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate DW-MRI has good diagnostic performance in the overall evaluation of hepatic metastases and equivalent to CE-MRI. Combination of CE-MRI and DW-MRI can improve the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Our study further confirms that DW-MRI can accurately detect hepatic metastases regardless  of the lesion size. It is suggested to perform DW-MRI by 3.0 T devices, which might have high specificity to identify liver metastases.',\n",

This concept emerged from work on neurodegenerative diseases and from recent data on metabolic alterations  in cancer cells affecting the RC and in particular on mutations of complex II subunits. It is also supported by experiments with many anticancer compounds that compared the apoptosis sensitivities of complex II-deficient versus WT cells. These results are explained by the mechanistic understanding of how complex II mediates the diverse range of apoptosis signals. This protein aggregate is specifically activated for apoptosis by pH change as a common and early feature of dying cells. This leads to the dissociation of its SDHA and SDHB subunits from the remaining membrane-anchored subunits and the consequent block of it enzymatic SQR activity, while its SDH activity, which is contained in the SDHA/SDHB subcomplex, remains intact. The uncontrolled SDH activity then generates excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species for the demise of the cell. Future studies on these mitochondrial processes will help refine this model, unravel the contribution of mutations in complex II subunits as the cause of degenerative neurological diseases and tumorigenesis, and aid in discovering novel interference options.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of three different doses of radium chloride (Ra 223) in patients with CRPC and bone metastases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 2 double-blind multicenter study, 122 patients were randomized to receive three injections of Ra 223 at 6-wk intervals, at doses of 25 kBq/kg (n=41), 50 kBq/kg (n=39), or 80 kBq/kg (n=42). The study compared the proportion of patients in each dose group who had a confirmed decrease of >/= 50% in baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Efficacy was evaluated using blood samples to measure PSA and other tumor markers, recorded skeletal-related events, and pain assessments.  Safety was evaluated using adverse events (AEs), physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests. The Jonckheere-Terpstra test assessed trends between groups. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The study met its primary end point with a statistically significant dose-response relationship in confirmed >/= 50% PSA declines for no patients (0%) in the 25-kBq/kg dose group, two patients (6%) in the 50-kBq/kg dose group, and five patients (13%) in the 80-kBq/kg dose group (p=0.0297). A >/= 50% decrease in bone alkaline phosphatase levels was identified in six patients (16%), 24 patients (67%), and 25 patients (66%) in the 25-, 50-,  and 80-kBq/kg dose groups, respectively (p<0.0001). The most common treatment-related AEs (>/= 10%) occurring up to week 24 across all dose groups were diarrhea (21%), nausea (16%), and anemia (14%). No difference in incidence of hematologic events was seen among dose groups. Potential limitations include small patient numbers and differences among dose groups at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Ra 223 had a dose-dependent effect on serum markers of CRPC activity, suggesting  that control of bone disease with Ra 223 may affect cancer-related outcomes.

Intervention arm men received annual prostate-specific antigen (6 years) and digital rectal exam (4 years). Men were followed for cancer diagnosis and mortality through 13 years. Medical record abstractors confirmed prostate cancer diagnoses, stage and grade. Prostate-specific survival in PLCO cases was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazards modeling. We utilized data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program to compute expected survival in PLCO  and compared this to observed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in prostate-specific survival rates between arms; 10 year survival rates were 94.7%  (intervention, n = 4250 cases) versus 93.5% (usual care, n = 3815 cases). Within  the intervention arm, cases never screened in PLCO had lower 10 year survival rates (82%) than screen detected or interval (following a negative screen) cases, both around 95.5%.

In this study, we provide evidence that PEI  and PLL induced autophagy in HeLa cervical cancer cells. In cells overexpressed with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) fusion protein, PEI and PLL induced fluorescent puncta formations that represent LC3 recruitment to autophagosomes. In Western blot analysis, conversions of the LC3-I to LC3-II were significant, and p62 degradation was observed in cells treated with PEI and PLL. At higher doses, the ability of endosomal escape by PEI facilitates the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II without the use of lysosomal protease inhibitors. From the analysis of annexin V-flourescein  isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining by flow cytometry, both  apoptosis and necrosis occurred in PEI- and PLL-treated cells. Significant activated caspase-3 expression was detected in PLL- and PEI-treated cells. By applying Z-VAD apoptotic inhibition, apoptosis and autophagy may occur independently or autophagy may be in the upstream of apoptosis on PEI- and PLL-treated cells. The degree of cell death was higher in incubated HeLa cells treated with PEI or PLL plus autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine (3-MA) and wortmannin). Treatment with these autophagy inhibitors, however, did not inhibit  LC3-II formation specifically. In addition, PEI and PLL induced higher degree of  cell death in atg5(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells than in wild-type  cells. Autophagy was also induced in PEI- and PLL-treated MEFs, as evidenced by the formation of LC3-II in wild-type-but not in atg5(-/-) MEFs. These results indicate that PEI and PLL can trigger both death and survival pathways simultaneously, and autophagy played a role in cell survival in PEI- and PLL-treated cells.

A common Matrigel-induced miRNA signature comprised of up-regulated miR-1290 and miR-210 and down-regulated miR-29b and miR-32 was identified using RT-qPCR across five epithelial cancer cell lines (SW480, SW620, HT-29, A549 and MDA-MB-231). Experimental modulation of these miRNAs altered expression of their  known target mRNAs involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and invasion, in colon cancer cell lines. Furthermore, ITGA5 was identified as a novel putative target of miR-32 that may facilitate cancer cell interactions with the ECM. We propose that culture of cancer cell lines in Matrigel more accurately recapitulates miRNA expression and function in cancer than culture on plastic and thus is a valuable approach to the in vitro study of miRNAs.',\n",

In addition, ERbeta  is predominately located in mitochondria. These facts led us to speculate that ERbeta may also be associated with HADHB in mitochondria. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy analyses  with human breast cancer MCF7 cells. The results demonstrated that ERbeta was indeed associated and colocalized with HADHB within mitochondria. Interestingly,  in contrast to the stimulatory effect of ERalpha on HADHB enzyme activity observed in the previous study, silencing of ERbeta enhanced the enzyme activity  of HADHB in the present study, suggesting that ERbeta plays an inhibitory role in HADHB enzyme activity in the breast cancer cells.

Here we show that long-term treatment with estradiol stimulated S100A7 expression in MCF7 breast cancer cells at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Both treatment with a histone demethylase LSD1 inhibitor and shRNA-based knockdown of LSD1 expression significantly decreased 17beta-estradiol (E2)-induced S100A7 expression.

The poor prognosis for patients with brain metastases is thought to be largely due to the presence of the blood-brain  barrier (BBB) that prevents delivery of most drugs to the CNS and to the heterogeneous and limited permeability of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB). Focused  ultrasound (FUS) bursts combined with circulating microbubbles can temporarily permeabilize both the BBB and the BTB. This technique has been investigated as a  potential noninvasive method for targeted drug delivery in the brain. Here, we investigated whether BBB/BTB permeabilization in the tumor and surrounding brain  tissue induced by FUS and microbubbles can slow tumor growth and improve survival in a breast cancer brain metastases model. HER2/neu-positive human breast cancer  cells (BT474) were inoculated in the brains of 41 nude (nu/nu) rats. Animals in the treatment group received six weekly treatments of BTB/BBB permeabilization under MRI guidance combined with IV administration of trastuzumab (2 mg/kg). Tumor growth and survival rates were monitored via MRI for seven weeks after sonication. Starting at week seven and continuing through the end of the study, the mean tumor volume of the FUS+trastuzumab group was significantly (P<0.05) less than those of the three control groups (no treatment, FUS alone, trastuzumab alone). Furthermore, in four out of 10 rats treated with FUS+trastuzumab, the tumor appeared to be completely resolved in MRI, an outcome which was not observed in any of the 31 rats in three control groups. Trastuzumab improved median survival by 13% compared to the no treatment group, a difference which was significant (P=0.044). Treatment with FUS+trastuzumab produced the most significant benefit compared to the no-treatment controls (P=0.0084). More than half (6/10) animals survived at the study endpoint, leading to a median survival  time greater than 83 days (at least 32% longer than the untreated control group).

Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) can modulate cell responses to injury through their interactions with soluble effector molecules. These interactions are often sulfate specific, and the removal of sulfate groups from HS side chains could be expected to influence cellular injury, such as that caused by exposure to cadmium. The goal of this study was to define the role 6-O-sulfate plays in cellular responses to cadmium exposure in two pulmonary epithelial cancer cell lines (H292 and A549) and in normal human primary alveolar type II (hAT2) cells. Sulfate levels were modified  by transduced transient over-expression of 6-O-endosulfatase (HSulf-1), a membrane-bound enzyme which specifically removes 6-O-sulfate groups from HSPG side chains. Results showed that cadmium decreased cell viability and activated apoptosis pathways at low concentrations in hAT2 cells but not in the cancer cells. HSulf-1 over-expression, on the contrary, decreased cell viability and activated apoptosis pathways in H292 and A549 cells but not in hAT2 cells. When combined with cadmium, HSulf-1 over-expression further decreased cell viability and exacerbated the activation of apoptosis pathways in the transformed cells but did not add to the toxicity in hAT2 cells. The finding that HSulf-1 sensitizes these cancer cells and intensifies the injury induced by cadmium suggests that 6-O-sulfate groups on HSPGs may play important roles in protection against certain environmental toxicants, such as heavy metals.',\n",

Because tumor size is also prognostic and  is associated with SUV(max), we sought to better characterize their relationship. We hypothesize that the ratio of SUV(max) to tumor size is a clinically useful measurement. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for patients (tumors >/= 1 cm) undergoing resection of NSCLC. Patients were placed into quartiles (SUV(max) and SUV(max) to tumor size ratio) and compared for clinical and pathologic factors. Predictors of SUV(max) and SUV(max) to tumor size ratio on survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 530 patients, increasing tumor size (odds ratio [OR], 2.04; confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.47; p < 0.001) was an independent predictor of higher SUV(max). Patients in quartiles by the ratio of SUV(max) to tumor size demonstrated no significant difference in median tumor size. Those patients with the highest ratios (QR4, 3.21-27.5) more frequently had poorly differentiated tumors (51%; p < 0.001), were likely to have lymph node metastases (30%; p < 0.001), and had poor 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) (58%; p = 0.013). On multivariate analysis, as a continuous variable SUV(max) to  tumor size ratio was a stronger independent predictor of survival than SUV(max) alone (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; CI, 1.00-1.13 versus HR, 1.02; CI, 0.99-1.06). Using cutpoint analysis, a high SUV(max) to tumor size ratio was also a stronger  predictor of survival than was high SUV(max) alone, particularly for tumors 1-3 cm (HR, 1.53; CI, 0.93-2.53 versus HR, 1.15; CI, 0.69-1.93). CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of SUV(max) to tumor size may be a more important indicator of prognosis than SUV(max) alone in patients with NSCLC.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between vitamin D status, smoking and CRA in an ethnically diverse community with a high  Hispanic density. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 233 patients  who underwent complete colonoscopies from 2009 to 2011, and their serum 25OHD levels in the winter season had been measured. Among them, 65 adenoma cases and 168 adenoma-free controls were identified and evaluated for the association of CRA with smoking, ethnicity and serum 25OHD level using unstratified and stratified multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: In our study participants, the mean serum 25OHD level and the percentage of Hispanics were lower in the adenoma group versus the control group, while no black-white difference was noted in the CRA prevalence. When adjusted for 25OHD level, the lower rate of adenoma in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics was attenuated and became statistically insignificant. A mild protective effect of vitamin D (6% reduction) on the CRA risk was found significant for active smokers, but not for  non-smokers. A detrimental impact of smoking in the CRA risk was only shown among non-Hispanic patients, but not among Hispanics irrespective of vitamin D status.  CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a marked distinction between Hispanics and non-Hispanics in the risk of CRA. The reduced adenoma prevalence among Hispanics  vs. non-Hispanics could be partially explained by vitamin D status, cigarette smoking and their interactions. Future larger-sized multi-center studies on vitamin D status and ethnicity, as well as dietary, behavioral, genetic factors and their interactions for CRA and CRC are needed.

This study was designed to evaluate the renoprotective activity of VIP against H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative damage in a proximal tubule kidney cell line (human, non-tumor, HK2 cells) in order to investigate the potential usefulness of this peptide in the treatment of oxidative-stress related kidney diseases. HK2 cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Propidium iodide was used to identify cells undergoing apoptosis. Western blotting was performed with anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax and anti-formyl peptide receptor (low-affinity variant FPRL-1) monoclonal antibodies whereas 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate was used for measurement of levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). HK2 cells were injured with H(2)O(2) in order to induce apoptosis: the effect was time- and dose-dependent. VIP increased the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased those of the proapoptotic protein Bax. VIP decreased the intracellular ROS levels reached  by H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress. VIP effect on ROS levels involved FPLR-1 but not VPAC(1,2) receptors as evidenced by the use of the respective antagonists WRW4 and JV-1-53. Thus, VIP protects HK2 cells from apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2 levels and this effect is initiated through FPLR1 receptor.

NAP  is a permeability factor as verified by miles permeability assay. The proangiogenic potential of NAP was identified using shell less CAM, rat cornea and tumor on CAM assays.

NAP is also involved in  migration and invasion of tumor cells. Clinical data revealed the presence of NAP in breast cancer biopsies. We have developed monoclonal antibody (mAb), and specific ELISA, which confirmed the presence of NAP in the cytosol of tumor cells. The mAb effect was evaluated with established angiogenic assays. Further,  we investigated the detailed mechanism by which NAP induces angiogenesis. NAP is  phosphorylated by VEGF induced activation of MAPK and JNK pathways through VEGFR2 phosphorylation. NAP involves JNK pathway predominantly with further activation of NFkappaB in downstream processing of VEGF activation. Together these findings  establish that NAP displays angiogenic properties and promotes efficient neovascularization both in vitro and in vivo models.

Previous studies have demonstrated that starvation-induced autophagy is regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (O(2)(.-)) but the source for ROS under starvation conditions and the downstream signaling pathways regulating  autophagy are unclear. In this study, a cervical cancer HeLa cell line was generated that was deficient in mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) (HeLa rho degrees cells). This resulted in endogenous levels of O(2)(.-) being significantly reduced and failed to be induced under starvation of glucose, L-glutamine, pyruvate, and serum (GP) or of amino acids and serum (AA) compared to wild type (wt) HeLa cells. In contrast, H(2)O(2) production failed to increase under GP starvation in both wild type and rho degrees cells whereas it increased  in wt cells but not in rho degrees cells under AA starvation. GP or AA starvation induced autophagy was blocked in rho degrees cells as determined by the amount of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Autophagy is regulated by 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and AMPK is activated under starvation conditions. We demonstrate that rho degrees cells and HeLa cells over expressing manganese-superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) cells fail to activate AMPK activation following starvation. This indicates that mitochondrial ROS might regulate AMPK activation. In addition, inhibiting AMPK activation either by siRNA or compound C resulted in reduced autophagy during starvation. Using a ROS scavenger NAC, AMPK activation is reduced under starvation condition and mTOR signaling is increased. Taken together, mitochondria-generated ROS induces autophagy mediated by the AMPK pathway under starvation conditions.\",\n",

We  assessed whether G-CSF or ESA were associated with progression or death in patients with ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients with ovarian cancer following surgery, were on a protocol to evaluate bevacizumab with chemotherapy. Guidelines for administering G-CSF and ESA were specified in the protocol. Overall survival  (OS) was analyzed with landmark procedures and multivariate, time-dependent hazard models. RESULTS: Eighteen-hundred-seventy-three women were enrolled, with  no differences in clinical and pathologic variables among treatment group. Performance status, hemoglobin, and white cell counts were associated with G-CSF  and/or ESA usage during treatment. Nine patients received no protocol directed therapy, leaving 1864 patients for this review. One-thousand-one-hundred-twenty-five patients received neither ESA nor G-CSF; 311 received G-CSF but no ESA; 241 received ESA but no G-CSF; and 187 received both.  Median survival following a five month landmark from the start of treatment was 34 versus 38 months for those who did versus did not receive ESA (multivariate hazard ratio: 0.989; 95% confidence interval: 0.849-1.15) and 40 versus 37 months for those who did versus did not receive G-CSF (multivariate hazard ratio: 0.932; 95% confidence interval: 0.800-1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Neither ESA nor G-CSF had a negative impact on survival after adjustment of prognostic factors among patients with ovarian cancer receiving chemotherapy. ESA may appear to be associated with  shorter survival in univariate analyses because factors prognostic for ESA use are also prognostic for progression-free survival.',\n",

The present study was designed to discriminate between tumour samples and non-cancer controls (healthy mucosa and oral lesions)  by analysing complete spectral patterns of intact cells using MALDI-ToF MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first step, a database consisting of 26 patients suffering from HNSCC was established by taking brush biopsy samples of the diseased area and of the healthy buccal mucosa of the respective contralateral area. After performing MALDI-ToF MS on these samples, classification analysis was used as the basis for further classification of an additional 26 blinded samples  including HNSCC, oral lesions and healthy mucosa. RESULTS: By analysing spectral  patterns of the blinded samples, all cancerous lesions were defined accurately. One incorrect evaluation (false positive) occurred in the lesion cohort, leading  to a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 93% and an overall accuracy of 96.5%.

However, the underlying mechanisms of the D5(H)-mediated suppressive effects remain to be elucidated. Here, we showed that D5(H) and its derivatives inhibited the collagen-mediated cell adhesion and invasion of human osteosarcoma MG63 cells. Using purified D5(H) fused to glutathione-S-transferase  (GST) and D5(H)-derived peptides for column chromatography, an actin-binding protein, alpha-actinin-4, was identified as a binding protein of D5(H) with high-affinity for P-5m, a core octapeptide of D5(H). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that D5(H) co-localized with alpha-actinin-4 inside MG63  cells. In addition, exogenous GST-D5(H) added to the culture media was transported into MG63 cells, although GST alone as a control was not.

Within this system, PNs are small (~500-600 muM diameter) membranous sac-like structures which contain numerous small cells which can be demonstrated by DAPI staining. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining of the peri-tumoral PVS shows the  presence of loose structures lined by fibroblasts but filled with dense fibers, cells, lacunae and nerve-like structures. The origin and type of cells within the PVS was characterized by immunostaining with antibodies for CD68, CD45 and lysozyme. The results of these studies reveal that the PVS of the xenograft originates from the human U937 tumor cells. qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from PVS cells reveals a striking predominance of human, rather than mouse, sequences. Of particular interest, human stem cell specific transcription factors were overexpressed, most notably KLF4, an upstream regulator of NANOG which maintains the pluripotent and undifferentiated state of stem cells. These results suggest that the cells present within the PVS are derived from the human xenograft and suggests that the primo-vessels associated with the xenografted tumor may provide a safe haven for a select population of cancer stem cells.

Currently, the most widely used method in clinical practice for monitoring the potential of chemotherapy-induced  cardiotoxicity is calculation of LV ejection fraction. The use of LV ejection fraction to determine whether to continue or discontinue the use of chemotherapeutic agents is limited, because decreases in LV ejection fraction frequently occur late and can be irreversible. These limitations have led to the  exploration of diastolic function and newer modalities that assess myocardial mechanics to identify sensitive and specific variables that can predict the occurrence of late systolic function. The cancer therapies associated with cardiotoxicity are reviewed in this report. Additionally, the authors evaluate the role of present-day echocardiographic parameters, complementary noninvasive imaging modalities, and biomarkers in the prediction of cardiotoxicity. The authors address the evolving role of cardioprotective agents and potential therapies to prevent or reverse the progression of LV systolic dysfunction. Finally, they provide some ideas regarding future directions to enhance the knowledge of predicting late-onset LV systolic dysfunction secondary to cancer therapy.',\n",

In order to improve cell penetration and solubility we added short poly arginine tails (5Rs), and initially solubilized the peptides in 1M trehalose. The results for one of the absent sequences 9R (RRRRRNWMWC), and its scrambled version 9S1R (RRRRRWCMNW) are reported here. We refer to these peptides derived from nullomers as PolyArgNulloPs. A control PolyArgNulloP, 124R (RRRRRWFMHW), was also included. The lethal effects of 9R and 9S1R are mediated by mitochondrial impairment as demonstrated by increased ROS production, ATP depletion, cell growth inhibition, and ultimately cell death. These effects increase over time for cancer cells with a concomitant drop in IC-50 for breast and prostate cancer  cells.

The development of small  molecules that modulate the stability of G-quadruplex structures has a potential  therapeutic interest in cancer treatment and prevention of aging. METHODS: Molecular absorption and circular dichroism spectra were used to monitor thermal  denaturation, acid base titration and mole ratio experiments. The resulting data  were analyzed by multivariate data analysis methods. Surface plasmon resonance was also used to probe the kinetics and affinity of the DNA-drug interactions. RESULTS: We investigated the interaction between a G-quadruplex-forming sequence  in the human c-kit proto-oncogene and the water soluble porphyrin TMPyP4. The role of cytosine and adenine residues at the loops of G-quadruplex was studied by substitution of these residues by thymidines. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show the existence of two binding modes between TMPyP4 and the considered G-quadruplex. The stronger binding mode (formation constant around 107) involves end-stacking,  while the weaker binding mode (formation constant around 106) is probably due to  external loop binding. Evidence for the release of TMPyP4 upon protonation of bases at the loops has been observed.

These abnormal vascular patterns have been recently described in great detail and demonstrated to be useful diagnostic tools in different settings of laryngeal cancer management: from preoperative diagnosis and staging to intraoperative evaluation of microsurgical margins and posttreatment follow-up. Particularly intriguing is the capacity of NBI to properly distinguish postactinic changes from persistent/recurrent disease.

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry combined with previously made tissue microarrays were used to study the expression of Wnt5a and LMP1 in the nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis tissues. We investigated the role of over expression of Wnt5a and LMP1 in the development and progression of NPC and their relation with the clinicopathological features of NPC and whether they could act as molecular markers in benign and malignant NPC. RESULTS: The positive percentage of Wnt5a and LMP1 protein expression in the NPC was significantly increased as compared with that in atypically hyperplastic nasopharyngeal epithelium, hyperplastic nasopharyngeal epithelium and histologically normal nasopharyngeal epithelium (P<0.05, P<0.01, and P<0.01). Wnt5a and LMP1 proteins were significantly higher in atypically hyperplastic nasopharyngeal epithelium than those in the hyperplastic nasopharyngeal epithelium and normal nasopharyngeal epithelium (P<0.05 and P<0.01). The positive expression of Wnt5a and LMP1 proteins in clinical T3 and T4 staged NPC was higher than that in clinical T1 and T2 staged NPC (P<0.01 and P<0.05). The positive expression of Wnt5a protein in the NPC with lymph node metastasis was higher than that in the NPC without lymph node metastasis (P<0.01). The positive percentage of LMP1 protein was significantly increased in non-keratinizing carcinoma compared with undifferentiated carcinoma and keratinizing carcinoma (P<0.05 and P<0.05). The expression of Wnt5a protein in the NPC had significant positive correlation with  LMP1 (r=0.354, P<0.001). Combined molecular phenotype of both Wnt5a and LMP1 expression was a good marker to distinguish NPC from non-cancerous nasopharyngeal epithelium. CONCLUSION: The expression of Wnt5a and LMP1 protein in the NPC is positively correlated, and both wnt5a and LMP1 protein play important roles in the nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis either together or successively promoting the malignant transformation of nasopharyngeal epithelium and the development and progression of NPC.

METHODS: We collected the clinical data and blood samples from 73 cases of papillary thyroid cancer and another 16 cases of benign  thyroid gland tumor, and detected the expression of rat sarcoma (RAS), BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 in all tumor specimens and benign thyroid tissues with immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: The expression of RAS, BRAF, pMEK1/2, and pERK1/2 protein in papillary thyroid cancer tissues was higher than  those in the benign thyroid tissues(P<0.05 or P<0.01). The expression of RAS, BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 was associated with the tumor size, the lymph node metastasis, and the clinical stage of papillary thyroid cancer(P<0.05 or P<0.01).

METHODS: From October 2011 to January 2012, 1635 post-surgery lung cancer patients from January 2002 to August  2011 were followed up by telephone interview. The data from follow-up and clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed. Among these patients, 116 patients with complete and reliable clinical data were further analyzed to determine the effective factors of lung cancer metastasis and long-term survival. RESULTS: The average response rate in the follow-up was 36.1%, and the response rate was related to the interval time after the operations. The shorter the interval, the higher the response rate. The response rate in female patients was  higher than that in male patients (P<0.001).The response rate was higher in patients younger than 40 (56 %) than that in the patients aged between 50-59 and  over 60 (39% and 24% respectively, P<0.001). There was no statistical difference  between patients from urban and rural areas (P=0.844). In the 116 patients with complete and reliable clinical data, statistical analysis confirmed that the metastasis and high lymph node staging were factors to increase patients' risk of death (with odd ratio 0.212 and 1.818 respectively, P<0.001). The adenocarcinoma  grade, high lymph node staging and advanced age were related to the metastasis risk (odds ratio 2.353, 2.181 and 2.908, respectively). CONCLUSION: Time, gender  and age are the influencing factors in the telephone follow-up.

We updated meta-analyses of published case-control and  cohort studies exploring occupational TCE exposure and kidney cancer risk, incorporating new analytical results from three recently published cohort studies and a case-control study. METHODS: PubMed MEDLINE was searched for studies published from 1950 to 2011 assessing occupational exposure to chlorinated solvents, degreasers or TCE. All cohort (N=15) and case-control (N=13) studies included in analyses were stratified by assessment of occupational exposure to TCE specifically and to any chlorinated solvent. RESULTS: Significantly elevated  summary estimates were observed for cohort studies (relative risk (RR) 1.26, 95%  CI 1.02 to 1.56; p heterogeneity=0.65), case-control studies (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.57; p heterogeneity=0.41), and cohort and case-control studies combined (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.50, p heterogeneity=0.63) that specifically assessed TCE exposure after excluding outlier studies that contributed to heterogeneity. Non-significantly elevated summary estimates were generally observed for studies  of workers exposed to chlorinated solvents but who were not assessed for TCE specifically. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of study design, significant and stronger estimates were only observed in studies specifically assessing occupational exposure to TCE. Estimates were lower in studies assessing occupational exposure  to chlorinated solvents. This updated meta-analysis supports an association between occupational TCE exposure and kidney cancer and provides evidence that exposure misclassification may weaken estimates assessing exposure to the broader class of chlorinated solvents.',\n",

We conducted a systematic MEDLINE search of articles in the published literature (last update, February 2012). Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of each study. We estimated pooled sensitivity, specificity, summary receiver operating characteristic curves, and summary likelihood ratios. A total of 409 patients from 10 studies were analyzed. The pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of 18F-FDG PET [PET/computed tomography (CT)] in the detection of pretherapeutic lymph node involvement in patients with CRC were 42.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 36.0-50.0%], 87.9% (95% CI: 82.6-92.0%), 2.82 (95% CI: 1.96-4.07), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.62-0.78), respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The uptake, retention and subcellular localization of these organic dyes were investigated in cultured kidney cancer cells. Tumor specificity of dye uptake and retention was evaluated by whole body imaging of mice bearing human kidney cancer xenografts or freshly harvested clinical kidney cancer specimens. In addition, dye accumulation at the tissue and cellular levels was confirmed by ex vivo studies with results confirmed by fluorescence imaging of frozen tissue sections. Peripheral blood spiked with kidney cancer cells was stained to simulate the detection of circulating tumor cells. RESULTS: Preferential uptake and retention  of carbocyanine near infrared dyes was observed in cultured human kidney cancer cells, human kidney cancer cell spiked whole blood, human kidney cancer xenografts and freshly harvested human kidney cancer tissues compared to normal kidney epithelial cells and normal host organs. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new class of near infrared heptamethine carbocyanine dyes that show potential for detecting kidney cancer cells in circulating blood and kidney cancer cells in clinical specimens.

Data regarding patient selection, complication rates and cancer outcomes are scarce. We report the largest, single institution series to date, to our knowledge, of salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: We reviewed our database of 4,234 patients treated with robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy at Vanderbilt University and identified 34 men who had surgery after the failure of prior definitive ablative therapy. Each patient had  biopsy proven recurrent prostate cancer and no evidence of metastases. The primary outcome measure was biochemical failure. RESULTS: Median time from primary therapy to salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy was 48.5 months with a median preoperative prostate specific antigen of 3.86 ng/ml. Most patients had Gleason scores of 7 or greater on preoperative biopsy, although 12 (35%) had Gleason 8 or greater disease. After a median followup of 16 months 18%  of patients had biochemical failure. The positive margin rate was 26%, of which 33% had biochemical failure after surgery. On univariable analysis there was a significant association between prostate specific antigen doubling time and biochemical failure (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.99, p = 0.049) as well as between Gleason score at original diagnosis and biochemical failure (HR 3.49, 95% CI 1.18-10.3, p = 0.023). There were 2 Clavien II-III complications, namely a pulmonary embolism and a rectal laceration. Postoperatively 39% of patients had excellent continence. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is safe, with many favorable outcomes compared to open salvage radical prostatectomy series. Advantages include superior visualization of the posterior prostatic plane, modest blood loss, low complication rates and short length of stay.',\n",

Multivariate analyses of prognostic factors for survival were performed both in overall population and in subgroups with and without DM. RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 124 patients (50%) who had less distant metastasis and more hypertension. Thirty patients received statin for hyperlipidemia.

Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of  specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific  signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities.

       " '23000902': {'AB': \"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that confers multidrug resistance in cancer cells. It also affects the absorption, distribution and clearance of cancer-unrelated drugs and xenobiotics. For these reasons, the structure and function of P-gp have been studied extensively for decades. Here we present biochemical characterization of P-gp from Caenorhabditis elegans and its crystal structure at a resolution of 3.4 angstroms. We find that  the apparent affinities of P-gp for anticancer drugs actinomycin D and paclitaxel are approximately 4,000 and 100 times higher, respectively, in the membrane bilayer than in detergent. This affinity enhancement highlights the importance of membrane partitioning when a drug accesses the transporter in the membrane. Furthermore, the transporter in the crystal structure opens its drug pathway at the level of the membrane's inner leaflet. In the helices flanking the opening to the membrane, we observe extended loops that may mediate drug binding, function as hinges to gate the pathway or both. We also find that the interface between the transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains, which couples ATP hydrolysis to transport, contains a ball-and-socket joint and salt bridges similar to the ATP-binding cassette importers, suggesting that ATP-binding cassette exporters and importers may use similar mechanisms to achieve alternating access for transport. Finally, a model of human P-gp derived from the structure of C. elegans P-gp not only is compatible with decades of biochemical analysis, but also helps to explain perplexing functional data regarding the Phe335Ala mutant.  These results increase our understanding of the structure and function of this important molecule.\",\n",

A role for the Hh pathway in mammary biology and breast cancer has also been suggested. The aim of  this study was to analyze Hh signaling in the mouse mammary gland through the generation of transgenic mice that express Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) under the control of the mammary-specific WAP promoter (WAP-Shh mice). To identify mammary cells capable of activating the Hh pathway we bred WAP-Shh mice to Ptch1-lacZ knock-in  mice, in which the expression of a nuclear-targeted beta-galactosidase reporter protein (beta-gal) is driven by the endogenous Patched 1 gene regulatory region.  After two cycles of induction of transgenic Shh expression, we detected areas of  X-gal reactivity. Immunohistochemical analysis showed nuclear beta-gal staining in clusters of mammary cells in WAP-Shh/Ptch1-lacZ bitransgenic mice. These were  epithelial cells present in a basal location of displastic ducts and alveoli, adjacent to Shh-expressing luminal cells, and overexpressed epithelial basal markers keratin 5, 14 and 17 and transcription factor p63. Absence of smooth muscle actin expression and a cuboidal morphology differentiated Hh-responding cells from flat-shaped mature myoepithelial cells. Groups of cells expressing stem cell markers integrin beta3 and keratins 6 and 15 were also detected within  Hh-responding areas. In addition, we found that Hh-responding cells in the mammary glands of WAP-Shh/Ptch1-lacZ mice were ciliated and exhibited a low proliferation rate. Our data show the paracrine nature of hedgehog signaling in the epithelial compartment of the mouse mammary gland, where a subset of basal cells that express mammary progenitor cell markers and exhibit primary cilia is expanded in response to secretory epithelium-derived Shh.',\n",

In this study, we investigated the  effect of elcatonin, a synthetic eel calcitonin, on oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in rats. The rats were treated with a single dose of oxaliplatin (6 mg/kg, i.p.) or repeated doses of paclitaxel (2 mg/kg, i.p.) on 4 alternate days. Both treatments resulted in cold and mechanical allodynia. We assessed the anti-allodynic effects of subcutaneously administered elcatonin (20  U/kg/day) by using a newly developed method to provide cold stimulation (8 degrees C) directly to the hind paw of the rats and by using the von Frey test. Elcatonin almost completely reversed the effects of both cold and mechanical allodynia. To determine the mechanism of this anti-allodynic effect, we examined  the effect of elcatonin on neuropathy induced by intraplantar injection of two organic compounds: allyl isothiocyanate (1 nmol/paw), which activates transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 channels, and menthol (1.28 mumol/paw), which activates transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 and melastatin-8. Pre-administration of elcatonin almost completely prevented cold and mechanical allodynia from being induced by both compounds. These results suggest that elcatonin attenuates oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain by inhibiting the cellular signaling related to transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 and melastatin-8. Thus, we conclude that administration of elcatonin may improve the quality of life of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.',\n",

Despite the ability of disseminated cancer cells to intravasate into distant tissues, it has been long recognized that only a limited subset of target organs develop clinically overt metastases. Therefore, subsequent adaptation of disseminated cancer cells to foreign tissue microenvironment determines the metastatic latency and tissue tropism of these cells. As a result, studying interactions between the disseminated cancer cells and the adjacent stromal cells will provide a better understanding of what constitutes a favorable or unfavorable microenvironment for disseminated cancer cells in a tissue-specific manner. Previously, we reported a  protein signature of brain metastasis showing increased ability of brain metastatic breast cancer cells to counteract oxidative stress. In this study, we  showed that another protein from the brain metastatic protein signature, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), has a dual function of regulating the metastatic growth of metastatic breast cancer cells and reducing the activation of immune response in  the brain. More importantly, increased NT-3 secretion in metastatic breast cancer cells results in a reversion of mesenchymal-like (EMT) state to epithelial-like (MET) state and vice versa. Ectopic expression of NT-3 in EMT-like breast cancer  cells reduces their migratory ability and increases the expression of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and E-cadherin at the cell-cell junction. In  addition, both endogenous and ectopic expression of NT-3 reduced the number of fully activated cytotoxic microglia. In summary, NT-3 appears to promote growth of metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain by facilitating the re-epithelialization of metastatic breast cancer cells and downmodulating the cytotoxic response of microglia. Most importantly, our results provide new insights into the latency and development of central nervous system macrometastases in patients with HER2-positive breast tumors and provide mechanistic rationale to target HER2 signaling for HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastasis.',\n",

Overexpression of miR-34a/c could inhibit breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and distal pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Further  studies revealed that Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1 or Fosl1) is a downstream target of miR-34a/c as miR-34a/c bound directly to the 3'untranslated region of Fra-1, subsequently reducing both the mRNA and protein levels of Fra-1. Silencing of Fra-1 recapitulated the effects of miR-34a/c overexpression, whereas enforced  expression of Fra-1 reverses the suppressive effects of miR-34a/c. Moreover, significant downregulation of miR-34a in metastatic breast cancer tissues was found to be inversely correlated with Fra-1 expression.

In order to ensure highly specific and sensitive detection, the  extracted RNAs should be free of the background nucleic acids and present stably  in a small volume. To meet these criteria, we designed a multi-well/multi-channel (M&M) chip to carry out automatic and selective isolation of small RNAs via solid-phase extraction (SPE), followed by reverse-transcription (RT) to convert them to the more stable cDNAs in a final volume of 2 muL. Droplets containing buffers for RNA binding, washing, and elution were trapped in microwells, which were connected by one channel, and suspended in mineral oil. The silica magnetic  particles (SMPs) for SPE were moved along the channel from well to well, i.e. in  between droplets, by a fixed magnet and a translation stage, allowing the nucleic acid fragments to bind to the SMPs, be washed, and then be eluted for RT reaction within 15 minutes. RNAs shorter than 63 nt were selectively enriched from cell lysates, with recovery comparable to that of a commercial kit. Physical separation of the droplets on our M&M chip allowed the usage of multiple channels for parallel processing of multiple samples. It also permitted smooth integration with on-chip RT-PCR, which simultaneously detected the target microRNA, mir-191,  expressed in fewer than 10 cancer cells.

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the impact of robotic surgery for rectal cancer on sexual and urinary functions in male and female patients. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: From April 2008 to December 2010, 74 patients undergoing  fully robotic resection for rectal cancer were prospectively included in the study. Urinary and sexual dysfunctions affecting quality of life were assessed with specific self-administered questionnaires in all patients undergoing robotic total mesorectal excision (RTME). Results were calculated with validated scoring  systems and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The analyses of the questionnaires completed by the 74 patients who underwent RTME showed that sexual function and general sexual satisfaction decreased significantly 1 month after intervention: 19.1 +/- 8.7 versus 11.9 +/- 10.2 (P < 0.05) for erectile function and 6.9 +/- 2.4 versus 5.3 +/- 2.5 (P < 0.05) for general satisfaction in men; 2.6 +/- 3.3 versus 0.8 +/- 1.4 (P < 0.05) and 2.4 +/- 2.5 versus 0.7 +/- 1.6 (P < 0.05) for arousal and general satisfaction, respectively, in women. Subsequently, both parameters increased progressively, and 1 year after surgery, the values were comparable to those measured before surgery. Concerning urinary function, the grade of incontinence measured 1 year after the intervention was unchanged for both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: RTME allows for preservation of urinary and sexual functions. This is probably due to the superior movements of the wristed instruments that facilitate fine dissection, coupled with a stable and magnified  view that helps in recognizing the inferior hypogastric plexus.',\n",

The 5-year survival rate of 57.8% was satisfactory, indicating the oncological feasibility of TAE. Perioperative outcomes affected overall survival in the whole cohort but not in the subgroup treated with 2 endoscopic stages. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the oncological feasibility of thoracoscopic-assisted esophagectomy (TAE) for esophageal cancer and to clarify the prognostic impact of perioperative factors after TAE. BACKGROUND: Favorable perioperative outcomes of TAE versus open surgery have been demonstrated. However, survival data after TAE in a large  cohort are limited, and no information on the prognostic influence of perioperative factors after TAE is available. METHODS: Prospectively collected data for 315 patients undergoing TAE for esophageal cancer were analyzed. Survival was compared with the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis  between 2 surgical approaches: thoracoscopic and hand-assisted laparoscopic esophagectomy (THLE) and thoracoscopic and open laparotomic esophagectomy (TOE).  Factors affecting overall survival were identified with Cox multivariate regression analysis in the whole cohort and the THLE subgroup. RESULTS: THLE and  TOE were performed in 153 and 162 patients, respectively. The overall 5-year survival of the whole cohort was 57.8%, with no difference between the THLE and the TOE group. Multivariate analysis of the 315 patients identified the following prognostic factors: blood loss, blood transfusion, intensive care unit stay, cardiovascular complications, pathological T and N stages, lymphatic invasion, intramural metastasis, and number of metastatic nodes. In the THLE subgroup, cerebral comorbidity, histological subtype, pathological T stage, and number of metastatic nodes were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: TAE was oncologically feasible. Perioperative factors affected survival in the whole cohort, but did not in the THLE subgroup. However, the reduced perioperative factor effect in this subgroup would be small because the survival rates of the 2 surgical approaches were equal.',\n",

BACKGROUND DATA: SSI is higher than expected after breast surgery. Obesity was found to be one of the risk factors. METHODS: The trial was designed as a phase IV randomized, controlled, parallel-group efficacy trial. It was conducted at a tertiary university hospital. Overweight or obese women with clinically early-stage breast cancer who had been assigned to undergo surgery were eligible. Patients were randomly allocated to either a prophylaxis or a control group by using a computer-generated list. The prophylaxis group received 1 g ampicillin-sulbactam  intravenously at anesthesia. The control group received no intervention. Patients and observers were blinded to the assignments. The primary outcome was the comparison of SSI incidences of the 2 groups. Patients were monitored for 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 369 patients were included in final analysis, out of which 187 were allocated for prophylaxis and 182 were randomly assigned to the control group. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle. Prophylaxis significantly reduced the SSI rate (4.8%) in the prophylaxis group when compared with that in the control group [13.7%; relative risk (RR) 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.73]. No adverse reaction was observed. The mean SSI-related cost (20.26 USD) was found to be significantly higher in the control group when compared with that (8.48 USD) in the prophylaxis group.

Furthermore,  we endeavored to provide a rationale for pulmonary metastasesectomy. BACKGROUND:  Several prognostic factors have been proposed, but clinical application of them remains unclear. Moreover, there is no theoretical evidence that pulmonary metastasectomy is indicated for colorectal cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1030 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer from 1990 to 2008. Prognostic factors were identified and the relationship of recurrent sites after pulmonary resection to pulmonary tumor size was assessed. RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival was 53.5%. Median survival time was 69.5 months. Univariate analysis showed tumor number (P < 0.0001), tumor size (P  < 0.0001), prethoracotomy serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P < 0.0001), lymph node involvement (P < 0.0001), and completeness of resection (P <  0.0001) to significantly influence survival. In multivariate analysis, all remained independent predictors of outcome. In patients whose recurrent sites extended downstream from the lung via hematogenous colorectal cancer spread, pulmonary tumor size was significantly larger than in those with recurrent sites  confined to the lung and regions upstream from the lung. CONCLUSIONS: We should utilize these prognostic factors to detect patients who might benefit from surgery. Therefore, we should periodically follow up advanced colorectal cancer patients by chest computed tomography to detect small pulmonary metastases before serum CEA elevation.

Despite advances in surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, its prognosis is still not promising. Hedgehog signaling pathway was reported to be involved in a number of cancers including head and neck. However, it remains unclear regarding the role of this pathway in NPC. By real-time PCR, we found Ptch1, Smo, and Gli-1 were expressed in all human nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues and cell lines. Compared with nasopharyngeal normal epithelial tissues, the mRNA expression level of Gli-1 was higher in carcinoma and nasopharyngitis (NPI) epithelial tissues. While compared with nasopharyngitis epithelia, the mRNA expression level of Ptch1 was lower in carcinoma epithelia and normal epithelia.  The expressions of Smo mRNA were not significantly different among these epithelial tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the expression level of Gli-1 was higher in NPC than NPI. Thus, our data indicated that aberrant activation of hedgehog pathway in NPC. Furthermore, blocking the pathway with cyclopamine inhibited the proliferation of NPC epithelia cell lines. In addition, blockade of the pathway in three NPC cell lines with cyclopamine-induced tumor cell apoptosis. The transcription of hedgehog target genes also is inhibited by cyclopamine. These data suggested that hedgehog pathway may sustain nasopharyngeal tumor growth.

In addition, rhLep failed to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria and had no effect on the activation of STAT3 in MGC-803 cells.

MRI with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences may be of additional value in distinguishing malignant from nonmalignant tissue. The  aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of tumor, nodal staging, and circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement by MRI with DCE sequences after CTx/RTx. METHODS: The accuracies were assessed by MRI on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images with DCE sequences in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after a long course of CTx/RTx. MR images were assessed by two independent radiologists. RESULTS: For tumor staging and CRM involvement, MRI with DCE sequences had an accuracy of 45 and 60 %, respectively. The accuracy for nodal staging was 93 %. On MRI, malignant lymph nodes had a median diameter of 8  mm (range, 4-18) and benign lymph nodes a median diameter of 4 mm (range, 3-11).  A significant indicator for benign nodes was hypointensity on T2-weighted images  (p < 0.001) and early complete arterial phase enhancement on DCE-weighted images  (p < 0.001). A significant indicator for malignant nodes was heterogeneity on T2-weighted images (chi (2), p < 0.000) and early incomplete arterial phase enhancement on DCE (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MRI with DCE is a useful tool for nodal staging after CTx/RTx. The addition of DCE sequences did not improve the accuracy of determining the tumor stage, CRM involvement, and in detecting complete response.',\n",

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology.  The body of evidence for each intervention, in each cancer treatment setting, was assigned an evidence level. Based on the evidence level, one of the following three guideline determinations was possible: recommendation, suggestion, and no guideline possible. RESULTS: A new recommendation was made for low-level laser (wavelength at 650 nm, power of 40 mW, and each square centimeter treated with the required time to a tissue energy dose of 2 J/cm(2) (2 s/point)) for the prevention of oral mucositis in adult patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell  transplantation conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy, with or without total body irradiation. A new suggestion was made for low-level laser (wavelength around 632.8 nm) for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients undergoing radiotherapy, without concomitant chemotherapy, for head and neck cancer. No guideline was possible in other populations and for other light sources due to insufficient evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing evidence in favor of low-level laser therapy allowed for the development of two new guidelines supporting this modality in the populations listed above. Evidence for other populations was also generally encouraging over a range of wavelengths and intensities.

Combining high-throughput RNA sequencing, functional characterization, mechanistic studies and clinical validation, we identify leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor downstream of the microRNA miR-9 and upstream of Hippo signaling. Restoring LIFR expression in highly malignant tumor cells suppresses metastasis by triggering a Hippo kinase cascade that leads to phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention and functional inactivation of the transcriptional coactivator YES-associated protein (YAP). Conversely, loss of LIFR in nonmetastatic breast cancer cells induces migration, invasion and metastatic colonization through activation of YAP. LIFR is downregulated in human breast carcinomas and inversely correlates with metastasis. Notably, in approximately 1,000 nonmetastatic breast  tumors, LIFR expression status correlated with metastasis-free, recurrence-free and overall survival outcomes in the patients.

Numerous findings of scientific research in vivo and in vitro indicate  that it is the population of undifferentiated, self-renewing cells which is responsible for recurrence of cancer and metastasis. Similarly to normal stem cells, cancer stem cells (CSC) function in the environment of the other cells of  the organism, called the niche, where they receive signals for differentiation and proliferation processes. Disorders in the signaling pathways between CSC and  the niche that result from e.g. acquired oncogenic mutations may lead to uncontrolled proliferation of stem cells, gaining independence from the primary niche or settling a new microenvironment. CSC are identified on the basis of specific markers - membrane proteins or cell enzymes. Methods based on the measurement of dye fluorescence (obtaining side population, SP) or fluorescence of the fluorophore conjugated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the specific CSC marker are used for isolation. A different method obtains morphologically miscellaneous clones by single cell cloning: holo-, mero- and paraclones. Tumor forming assay in NOD/SCID mice is a standard in vivo test that  confirms the stem character of isolated cells.

We used the prospective Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study to assess whether iron metrics were associated with gastric cardia cancer (GCC) and  gastric noncardia cancer (GNCC). METHODS: We selected 341 incident gastric cancer cases (86 cardia, 172 noncardia, and 83 nonspecified), accrued during 22 years of follow-up, and 341 individually matched controls. We measured prediagnostic serum iron, ferritin, unsaturated iron binding capacity, and C-reactive protein. Total  iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation were estimated from these metrics. Dietary iron exposures were estimated from a food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was used for analysis. RESULTS:  Serum iron metrics were not associated with GCC, except for a potential \"n\"-shaped relationship with TIBC (global P = 0.038). GNCC was inversely associated with serum ferritin (global P = 0.024), serum iron (global P = 0.060)  and, possibly, transferrin saturation. TIBC appeared to share a \"u\"-shaped relationship with GNCC (global P = 0.033). Dietary iron exposures were not associated with either subsite. Adjustment for Helicobacter pylori and gastric atrophy had little effect on observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: We found little  evidence for the involvement of iron exposure in the pathogenesis of GCC. GNCC was associated with an iron profile similar to that of iron deficiency. IMPACT: Our findings indicate that inverse associations between iron metrics and gastric  cancer are driven by associations with GNCC. Further elucidation of potential mechanisms is warranted.',\n",

Reduced 5-mC levels in peripheral blood leukocytes have been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma in cross-sectional studies. METHODS: To minimize disease- and/or treatment-related effects, we studied leukocyte 5-mC levels in prospectively collected blood specimens of 370 cases and 493 controls who were cancer-free at blood collection from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Leukocyte 5-mC level was determined by a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)/tandem mass spectrometry method and expressed as the relative amount of methyl to total cytosine residues, or %5-mC. We estimated the association between colorectal cancer risk and %5-mC categories by computing ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) through logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: We observed no dose-dependent association between colorectal cancer and%5-mC categories (lowest vs. highest tertile: OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.80-1.63; P(trend) = 0.51). However, among subjects whose 5-mC levels were at the highest tertile, we observed an inverse association between natural folate intake and colorectal cancer (highest tertile of natural folate vs. lowest: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.71; P(trend) = 0.003; P(interaction)  = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective investigation show no clear association between leukocyte 5-mC level and subsequent colorectal cancer risk but a suggestive risk modification between 5-mC level and natural folate intake.

What is unclear, however, is the impact of quitting smoking on risk attenuation and whether other risk factors for CRC modify this association. METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of eight studies, including 6,796 CRC cases and 7,770 controls, to evaluate the association between cigarette smoking history and CRC risk and to investigate potential effect modification by other risk factors. RESULTS: Current smokers [OR, 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.43] and former smokers (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.27), relative to never smokers, showed higher risks of CRC. Former smokers remained at higher CRC risk, relative to never smokers, for up to about 25 years after quitting. The impact of time since quitting varied by cancer subsite: The excess risk due to smoking decreased immediately after quitting for  proximal colon and rectal cancer but not until about 20 years post-quitting for distal colon cancer. Furthermore, we observed borderline statistically significant additive interactions between smoking status and body mass index [BMI; relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI]), 0.15; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.31; P = 0.06] and significant additive interaction between smoking status and fruit consumption (RERI, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.01-0.30; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: CRC risk remained increased for about 25 years after quitting smoking, and the pattern of  decline in risk varied by cancer subsite.

The concept of the injection of carbon dioxide microbubbles into the hepatic artery as a contrast material (enhanced ultrasonography) led to \"endoscopic ultrasonographic angiography\". After the arrival of the first-generation contrast agent, high-frequency (12 MHz) EUS brought about the enhancement of EUS images in the diagnosis of pancreatico-biliary diseases, upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, and submucosal tumors. The electronic scanning endosonoscope with both radial and linear probes enabled the use of high-end ultrasound machines and depicted the enhancement of both color/power Doppler flow-based imaging and harmonic-based imaging using second-generation contrast agents. Many reports have described the usefulness of the differential diagnosis  of pancreatic diseases and other abdominal lesions. Quantitative evaluation of CE-EUS images was an objective method of diagnosis using the time-intensity curve (TIC), but it was limited to the region of interest. Recently developed Inflow Time Mapping can be generated from stored clips and used to display the pattern of signal enhancement with time after injection, offering temporal difference of  contrast agents and improved tumor characterization. On the other hand, three-dimensional CE-EUS images added new information to the literature, but lacked positional information. Three-dimensional CE-EUS with accurate positional  information is awaited. To date, most reports have been related to pancreatic lesions or lymph nodes. Hemodynamic analysis might be of use for diseases in other organs: upper GI cancer diagnosis, submucosal tumors, and biliary disorders, and it might also provide functional information.

In some other solid tumors, (18)F-FDG PET may offer prognostic information that can  guide optimal patient treatment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether preoperative (18)F-FDG PET based on SUVs assessments has a prognostic value in ACC patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the evaluation of ACC. Inclusion criteria were an unequivocal diagnosis of ACC; all data from primary diagnosis available; (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed prior to surgery or other treatment of the  primary tumor; a minimum of 6-months follow-up for surviving patients. All (18)F-FDG PET/CT procedures were reinterpreted in a blind fashion. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (23 without metastasis [M0], 14 with metastasis [M1]) fulfilled the study criteria. Median uptake values were tumor standardized uptake values (SUV)(max) = 11 (range: 3-56) and a tumor/liver SUV(max) ratio = 4.2 (range: 1.3-15). Median follow-up was 20 months. Although classic risk factors (tumoral stage, Weiss score) were associated with poor outcome, there was no correlation between primary tumor FDG uptake with overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) in M0 patients and with overall survival in M1 patients. (18)F-FDG uptake correlated inconsistently with sinister histological features, such as atypical mitoses or necrosis.

One hundred twenty-four  pT1 size lung adenocarcinomas were examined for visceral pleural invasion, which  was classified into three types: no pleural invasion (NPI), invasion of the inner elastic layer only (IEL), and invasion of both inner and outer elastic layers (OEL). The relationship between the types of VPI and the prognosis was analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Seventy-three (59 %) cancers showed NPI, while 51 cancers showed invasion of the pleura [(IEL) in 26 (21 %), OEL in 25 (20 %)]. The 5-year survival was 81, 60, and 37 % for patients with NPI, IEL, and OEL, respectively. Survival was poorest in patients with OEL (P < 0.01). Invasion of the outer elastic layer was also significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and frequent lymphatic involvement, micropapillary pattern, higher stromal invasion grade, and presence of small cluster invasion within tumors. Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between invasion of the outer elastic layer and poor prognosis.

Tumor subtypes were approximated based on hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status of the primary cancer: Luminal A/B (HR+/HER2(-)); HER2 (HER2+/HR(-)); Luminal HER2 (HR+/HER2+), Basal (HR(-)/HER2(-)), and then based on HER2 status alone.

The function of ADAMTS1 in gastric cancer remains unknown. Therefore, we were interested in examining ADAMTS1 expression in human gastric cancer, as well as its possible correlation with angiogenesis. METHODS: The mRNA and protein expression of ADAMTS1, thrombospondin type I (TSP1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was evaluated by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, in 56 paired tumor and normal tissue samples, and corresponding metastatic lymph nodes (n = 42). Microvessel density (MVD) was also evaluated by  immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: ADAMTS1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower in primary tumors than in corresponding normal tissues, and were significantly higher in metastatic lymph nodes compared to their matched primary  tumors. High ADAMTS1 mRNA and protein expression was found to be significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in primary tumors. There was a negative correlation between ADAMTS1 and VEGF mRNA and protein expression in primary gastric tumors and normal tissues. A negative correlation was also found between  ADAMTS1 protein expression and MVD in primary gastric tumors. In contrast, no correlation was detected between ADAMTS1 and TSP1 mRNA and protein expression in  primary gastric tumors, normal tissues, and metastatic lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS:  These findings suggest that ADAMTS1 expression is altered in primary gastric cancer and paired lymph node metastasis. In addition, ADAMTS1 has angioinhibitory effects in primary gastric cancer due to its low expression and negative correlation with VEGF and MVD. However, it appears to lose its anti-angiogenic activity in metastatic lymph nodes in gastric cancer.',\n",

No proven screening strategies are available and frequent cross-sectional imaging studies (CT/MRI) are impractical even in patients thought to be at higher risk than the general population. Few PDA biomarkers have been studied prospectively for screening. Here, we prospectively evaluated the Adnab-9 monoclonal antibody in stool, pancreaticobiliary secretions, and tissue for screening and prognostic value in sporadic PDA. We also evaluated the prognostic  value of characterized early biomarkers in pancreaticobiliary secretions. METHODS: Adnab-9 diagnostic ability was tested in stool in 249 and 1,132 patients from China and the US, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 22 tissue samples with Adnab-9 antibody and anti-Defensin 5, a constituent of Paneth cells. Pancreatobiliary secretions were collected from 12 PDA patients and 9 controls. The enriched PCR method was performed to detect K-ras mutations. ELISA  was performed with Adnab-9, anti-Her-2/neu, and monoclonal antibody D4 (anti-Reg  I). RESULTS: Adnab-9 alone was diagnostic and prognostic when measured in pancreatic secretions, feces, and tissues of PDA patients compared to controls (p < 0.05). Significantly, Adnab-9 fecal binding can precede the clinical diagnosis  by 2.3 years, potentially allowing earlier clinical intervention. In pancreatic secretions, a combination of K-ras and Her-2/neu when appropriately standardized  can be diagnostic in 75 % of PDA. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Adnab-9 may be an effective marker for diagnosis and prognosis of PDA. Adnab-9 may be reflective of the presence of Paneth cells confirmed by Defensin-5 staining.

Gemcitabine  is the standard first-line chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer, however  the chemoresistance limits the curative effect. AIMS: In the present study, we investigated whether inhibition of miR-17-5p could enhance chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: miR-17-5p inhibitor was transfected to pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1 and BxPC3, and then cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, and chemosensitivity to gemcitabine were measured in vitro. RESULTS: Our data showed that Panc-1 and BxPC3 cells transfected with miR-17-5p inhibitor showed growth inhibition, spontaneous apoptosis, higher caspase-3 activation, and increased chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. In addition, miR-17-5p inhibitor upregulated Bim protein expression in a dose-dependent manner without changing the Bim mRNA level, and it increased the activity of a luciferase reporter construct containing the Bim-3' untranslated region. CONCLUSIONS: These results prove that  miR-17-5p negatively regulates Bim at the posttranscriptional level. We suggest that miR-17-5p inhibitor gene therapy would be a novel approach to chemosensitization for human pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

It has been demonstrated that the electronic portal imaging device (EPID) is valuable for transit portal dosimetry verification. Patient related dose differences can emerge at any time during treatment and can be categorized in two types: (1) systematic-appearing repeatedly, (2) random-appearing sporadically during treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate how systematic and random information appears in 2D transit dose distributions measured in the EPID plane over the entire course of a treatment and how this information can be used to examine interfractional trends, building toward a methodology to support adaptive radiotherapy. To create a trend overview of the interfractional changes in transit dose, the predicted portal dose for the different beams is compared to a measured portal dose using a gamma evaluation. For each beam of the delivered fraction, information is extracted from the gamma  images to differentiate systematic from random dose delivery errors. From the systematic differences of a fraction for a projected anatomical structures, several metrics are extracted like percentage pixels with |gamma| > 1. We demonstrate for four example cases the trends and dose difference causes which can be detected with this method. Two sample prostate cases show the occurrence of a random and systematic difference and identify the organ that causes the difference. In a lung cancer case a trend is shown of a rapidly diminishing atelectasis (lung fluid) during the course of treatment, which was detected with  this trend analysis method. The final example is a breast cancer case where we show the influence of set-up differences on the 2D transit dose. A method is presented based on 2D portal transit dosimetry to record dose changes throughout  the course of treatment, and to allow trend analysis of dose discrepancies. We show in example cases that this method can identify the causes of dose delivery differences and that treatment adaptation can be triggered as a result. It provides an important element toward informed decision-making for adaptive radiotherapy.',\n",

METHODS: We compared the susceptibility of putative CSC generated from cancer cell lines to immunologic recognition and killing by alloantigen-specific CD8(+) CTL. CSC-enriched spheroid culture-derived cells (SDC) exhibited higher expression of ALDH, ICAM1 and of stem/progenitor cell markers on all 3 tumor cell lines investigated and lower MHC class I on the cervical cancer cell line as compared to their monolayer-derived cells (MDC). RESULTS: The expression of ICAM1 and MHCI was upregulated by IFN-gamma treatment. CSC populations were less sensitive to MHC class I-restricted alloantigen-specific CD8(+) CTL lysis as compared to matched MDC. IFN-gamma pretreatment resulted in over-proportionally enhanced lysis of SDC. Finally, the subset of ALDH(high) expressing SDC presented more sensitivity toward CD8(+) CTL killing than the ALDH(low) SDC. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor therapy resistance has been attributed to cancer stem cells (CSC). We show in vitro susceptibility of CSC to CTL-mediated lysis. Immunotherapy targeting of ALDH(+) CSC may therefore be a promising approach. Our results and method may be helpful  for the development and optimization of adjuvants, as here exemplified for INF-gamma, for CSC-targeted vaccines, independent of the availability of CSC-specific antigens.\",\n",

However, the potential role that GBP2 plays in tumor development and prognosis has not yet been studied. METHODS: We analyzed whether GBP2 mRNA levels are associated with metastasis-free interval in 766 patients with node negative breast carcinomas who did not receive systemic chemotherapy. Furthermore, response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy was studied in 768 breast cancer patients. RESULTS: High expression of GBP2 in breast carcinomas was associated with better prognosis in the univariate (P < 0.001, hazard ratio 0.763, 95 % CI 0.650-0.896) as well as in the multivariate Cox analysis (P = 0.008, hazard ratio 0.731, 95 % CI 0.580-0.920) adjusted to the established clinical factors age, pT stage, grading, hormone and ERBB2 receptor status. The association was particularly strong in subgroups with high proliferation and positive estrogen receptor status but did not reach significance in carcinomas with low expression of proliferation associated genes. Besides its prognostic capacity, GBP2 also predicted pathologically complete response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy (P = 0.0037, odds ratio 1.39, 95 % CI 1.11-1.74). Interestingly, GBP2 correlated with a recently established T cell  signature, indicating tumor infiltration with T cells (R = 0.607, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: GBP2 is associated with better prognosis in fast proliferating tumors and probably represents a marker of an efficient T cell response.',\n",

Among 290 gastric cancer case-control sets selected from the Korean Multicenter Cancer Cohort, the plasma  concentrations of soluble c-Met protein were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Using analysis of variance and covariance models with age,  sex, smoking, Helicobacter pylori infection, and CagA seropositivity, the mean concentrations of soluble c-Met protein between cases and controls were compared. To evaluate the association between gastric cancer and a c-Met protein level, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using conditional logistic regression models. Interactions between CagA-related genes and the soluble c-Met protein concentration were also investigated. The overall median plasma concentration of soluble c-Met among cases was significantly lower than those of controls (1.390 vs. 1.610 ng/mL, p < 0.0001). Closer to the onset of gastric cancer, the soluble c-Met protein level decreased linearly in a time-dependent manner (p for trend = 0.0002). The combined effects between the CagA-related genes and the soluble c-Met protein concentration significantly intensified risks for gastric cancer. Restricted analyses including cases that had been diagnosed within 1 year after entering the cohort had a fair degree of ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73-0.77) to  discriminate gastric cancer cases from normal controls.

Removal of precancerous adenomas, and early detection and treatment of cancer, has been shown to reduce the risk of death. The aim of this review and meta-analysis was to determine whether flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) is an effective population screening method for reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. METHODS: MEDLINE  (1946 to December 2012) and Embase (1980-2012, week 15) were searched for randomized clinical trials in which FS was used to screen non-symptomatic adults  from a general population, and FS was compared with either no screening or any other alternative screening methods. Meta-analysis was carried out using a random-effects Mantel-Haenzsel model. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers met the inclusion criteria, reporting results from 14 trials. Uptake of FS was usually lower than that for stool-based tests, although FS was more effective at detecting advanced adenoma and carcinoma. FS reduced the incidence of colorectal  cancer after screening, and long-term mortality from colorectal cancer, compared  with no screening in a selected population. Compared with stool-based tests in a  general population, FS was associated with fewer interval cancers. CONCLUSION: FS is efficacious at reducing colorectal cancer mortality compared with no screening. It is more effective at detecting advanced adenoma and carcinoma than  stool-based tests. FS may be compromised by poorer uptake. Introduction of FS as  a screening method should be done on a pilot basis in populations in which it is  not currently used, and close attention should be paid to maximizing uptake.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miRNAs in gastric carcinogenesis and the feasibility of a new therapeutic approach for gastric cancer. miRNA expression profiles were examined in 53 gastric tumors including gastric adenomas (atypical epithelia), early gastric cancers and advanced gastric cancers and in gastric cancer cells treated with celecoxib. miRNA microarray analysis revealed that miR-29c was significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues relative to nontumor gastric mucosae. miR-29c was significantly activated by celecoxib in gastric cancer cells. Downregulation of miR-29c was associated with progression of gastric cancer and was more prominent in advanced gastric cancers than in gastric adenomas and early gastric cancer. In addition, expression of the oncogene Mcl-1, a target of miR-29c, was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues relative to nontumor gastric mucosae. Activation of miR-29c by celecoxib induced  suppression of Mcl-1 and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.

Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in centrobin and four SNPs in Nek2 were genotyped in 1,215 cases of infiltrating ductal breast cancer and 1,215 age-matched cancer-free controls from Chinese Han population. The results showed that CATCG haplotype of  centrobin was strongly associated with decreased breast cancer risk (adjusted OR  = 0.14, 95 % CI = 0.09-0.22), which was mainly driven by the C allele of SNP rs11650083 (A>C, located in exon 12, resulting in Pro578Gln). None of the individual SNPs in Nek2 was associated with breast cancer risk. However, haplotype GTAT of Nek2 was associated with increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted OR = 1.56, 95 % CI = 1.18-2.06) and its risk was significantly elevated among women with both family history of cancer and a longer menarche-first full-term pregnancy (FFTP) interval (>11 years) (adjusted OR = 5.31, 95 % CI = 1.97-14.32). Furthermore, women harboring both at-risk haplotype GTAT of Nek2 and protective haplotype CATCG of centrobin were linked with decreased breast cancer  risk, suggesting that the association between genetic variants of Nek2 and increased breast cancer risk was modified by genetic variants of centrobin.

The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints included response rate and evaluation of platelet-associated proteins. Twenty three patients were treated and evaluable for toxicity. Common mild toxicities included nausea, vomiting, LFTs abnormalities, fatigue, and rash. Three episodes of dose-limiting toxicity occurred in C3. In all cohorts, 1/3 of patients required vandetanib dose reduction, and 22 % ended therapy for toxicity. Of the 20 response-evaluable patients, 10 % demonstrated partial response and 15 % stable disease >/=24 weeks. Proteomic analyses demonstrated changes in platelet content of angiogenesis regulators, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet factor 4, with exposure to therapy. This regimen was tolerable at a maximum vandetanib dose of 200 mg; modest clinical activity was observed in this heavily pretreated population. Changes in the platelet proteome may serve as pharmacodynamic markers of angiogenesis inhibition.

Retinoic acid (RA) acts as a negative regulator of PcG actions in stem cells, but has shown limited therapeutic potential in some solid  tumors, including colorectal cancer, in part because of retinoic acid receptor beta silencing. Through treatment with RA, Suz12 shRNA knockdown, or Ezh2 pharmacological inhibition with 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), we increased TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cell lines. This increased apoptosis in human colon cancer cells after RA or DZNep treatment was associated  with a ~2.5-fold increase in TNFRSF10B (DR5) transcript levels and a 42% reduction in the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark at the TNFRSF10B promoter after DZNep addition.

We have shown that 25 mum 10-(octyloxy) decyl-2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl phosphate (ODPC), an alkylphospholipid, targets high cholesterol domains in model membranes and induces apoptosis in leukemia cells but spares normal hematopoietic and epithelial cells under the same conditions. We performed a quantitative (SILAC) proteomic screening of ODPC targets in a lipid-raft-enriched fraction of leukemic cells to identify early events prior to the initiation of apoptosis. Six proteins, three with demonstrated palmitoylation sites, were reduced in abundance. One, the linker for activation of T-cell family member 2 (LAT2), is an adaptor protein associated with lipid rafts in its palmitoylated form and is specifically expressed in B lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Interestingly, LAT2 is not expressed in K562, a cell line more resistant to ODPC-induced apoptosis. There was an early loss of LAT2 in the lipid-raft-enriched fraction of NB4 cells  within 3 h following treatment with 25 mum ODPC. Subsequent degradation of LAT2 by proteasomes was observed. Twenty-five mum ODPC inhibited AKT activation via myeloid growth factors, and LAT2 knockdown in NB4 cells by shRNA reproduced this  effect. LAT2 knockdown in NB4 cells also decreased cell proliferation and increased cell sensitivity to ODPC (7.5x), perifosine (3x), and arsenic trioxide  (8.5x). Taken together, these data indicate that LAT2 is an early mediator of the anti-leukemic activity of alkylphospholipids and arsenic trioxide. Thus, LAT2 may be used as a target for the design of drugs for cancer therapy.',\n",

Defective apoptosis represents an important causative factor in the development/progression of cancer, and the ability of tumor cells to evade apoptosis can play a significant role in their resistance to conventional anticancer treatment. We investigated the expression profile of genes involved in the apoptotic mechanism in 21 paired tissue samples (OSCC and adjacent normal oral mucosa) by cDNA macroarray, in order to identify differentially expressed genes in oral cancer compared to normal tissue. To validate the results obtained  by cDNA macroarray, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Results obtained by cDNA macroarray  analysis showed different expression levels of CRADD, FADD, ATM, APAF1, and TP63  genes in OSCC compared to normal mucosa. Differential gene expression measurements (tumor vs. normal tissue) performed by real-time PCR showed an overexpression of FADD and a downregulation of ATM. Moreover, Western blot analysis confirmed that both CRADD and APAF-1 were decreased in OSCC compared to  normal oral mucosa.

Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an active component of the spice turmeric, has attracted interest because of its anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive activities. However, no study has been carried out so far to elucidate its interaction with bleomycin in testicular cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of curcumin and bleomycin on apoptosis signalling pathways and compared the effects of bleomycin with H2O2 which directly produces  reactive oxygen species. We measured apoptosis markers such as caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities and Bcl-2, Bax, and Cyt-c levels in NCCIT cells incubated with curcumin (5 muM), bleomycin (120 mug/ml), bleomycin + curcumin, H2O2 (35 muM), and H2O2 + curcumin for 72 h. Curcumin, bleomycin, and H2O2 caused apoptosis indicated as increases in caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities and Bax and cytoplasmic Cyt-c levels and a decrease in Bcl-2 level. Concurrent use of curcumin with bleomycin decreased caspase activities and Bax and Cyt-c levels compared to their separate effects in NCCIT cells.

We investigated the molecular mechanism of expression of ANXA8 in cancer cells and its functional role in pancreatic cancer  cells. ANXA8 was diversely expressed in human cancer cell lines. Expression was enhanced by treatment with 5-aza-dC and butyrate, and correlated with methylation status at CpG in the promoter-exon 1 region. Inhibition of ANXA8 using siRNA in BxPC-3 cells which express ANXA8 at a high level elevated caspase-3 and -7 activities. In in vitro invasion assay, inhibition of ANXA8 using siRNA in BxPC-3 reduced the numbers of migrating cells, and down-regulated HIF-1alpha mRNA transcription. Overexpression of ANXA8 increased the number of viable cells and BrdU incorporation in PANC-1 cells, which express ANXA8 at a low level. Expression of ANXA8 was induced under conditions of nutrient deprivation, and overexpression of ANXA8 showed resistance against serum starvation in PANC-1 cells. In a promoter assay, co-transfection with the expression vector of ANXA8 and the vector of a reporter gene containing the promoter of HIF-1alpha enhanced  HIF-1alpha promoter activity. In contrast, this effect of ANXA8 was inhibited by  administration of BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca(2)(+) chelator.

However, this imaging method is hindered by relatively low signal contrast. Here, gold nanoprisms (AuNPrs) are used as signal amplifiers in multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to visualize gastrointestinal cancer. PEGylated AuNPrs are successfully internalized by HT-29 gastrointestinal cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, the particles show good biocompatibility and exhibit a surface plasmon band centered at 830 nm, a suitable wavelength for optoacoustic imaging purposes. These findings extend well to an in vivo setting, in which mice are injected with PEGylated AuNPrs in order to visualize tumor angiogenesis in gastrointestinal cancer cells.

For cancer patients, clinical trials have been carried out to compare concurrent palliative  care with usual cancer care in terms of longitudinal measurements of quality of life (QOL) until death, and overall survival is usually treated as a secondary endpoint. It is known that QOL of patients with advanced cancer decreases as death approaches; however, in previous clinical trials, this association has generally not been taken into account when inferences about the effect of an intervention on QOL or survival have been made. We developed a new joint modeling approach, a terminal decline model, to study the trajectory of repeated measurements and survival in a recently completed palliative care study. This approach takes the association of survival and QOL into account by modeling QOL retrospectively from death. For those patients whose death times are censored, marginal likelihood is used to incorporate them into the analysis. Our approach has two submodels: a piecewise linear random intercept model with serial correlation and measurement error for the retrospective trajectory of QOL and a piecewise exponential model for the survival distribution. Maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters are obtained by maximizing the closed-form expression of log-likelihood function. An explicit expression of quality-adjusted life years can also be derived from our approach.

METHODS: A total of 3511 patients with an adnexal mass underwent transvaginal ultrasound examination between 1999 and 2007. Sonologists used the International  Ovarian Tumor Analysis terms and definitions to describe their ultrasound findings. Only masses operated on within 120 days after the ultrasound examination were included in the analysis and the histopathological diagnosis of  the mass was used as the gold standard. RESULTS: Of the 3511 masses, 1148 (33%) were classified as unilocular cysts on ultrasound. Of these, 11 (0.96% (95% CI, 0.48-1.71)) were malignant. The malignancy rate was lower in premenopausal than in postmenopausal women: 0.54% (5/931; 95% CI, 0.17-1.25) vs. 2.76% (6/217; 95% CI, 1.02-5.92); P = 0.009. More patients with malignant unilocular cysts had a personal history of breast cancer (18% vs. 2%; P = 0.02) or ovarian cancer (18% vs 0.6%; P = 0.003). Hemorrhagic cyst contents on ultrasound were more common in  malignant than in benign unilocular cysts (18% vs. 2%; P = 0.03). In seven of the 11 malignancies judged to be unilocular cysts at scan, papillary projections or other solid components were seen at macroscopic inspection of the surgical specimen. CONCLUSIONS: The malignancy rate in surgically removed adnexal lesions  judged to be unilocular cysts at transvaginal scan is c 1%. Postmenopausal status, personal history of breast or ovarian cancer and hemorrhagic cyst contents on ultrasound increase the risk of malignancy. To avoid misclassifying adnexal lesions as unilocular cysts at scan, it is important to scrutinize unilocular cysts for the presence of solid components.',\n",

Compared to other CAS proteins, Hepl has a varying effect on cell migration in different cell types. We speculated that Hepl may play a role in lung cancer invasion and metastasis. We quantified the expression and subcellular localization of Hepl in  143 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues, adjacent noncancerous tissues, and eight lung cancer cell lines using Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescent staining. Expression of Hepl was correlated with the clinicopathological features of NSCLC. Hepl was overexpressed in 72.3 % (103/143) of the NSCLC tissues, compared to the adjacent noncancerous lung tissues (P = 0.022). Overexpression of Hepl was associated with lymph node metastasis and high TNM stage (P = 0.005 and P = 0.045, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test indicated that overexpression of Hepl correlated with poorer overall survival in NSCLC (P < 0.001), and Cox regression analysis demonstrated that overexpression of Hepl was an independent prognostic factor in  NSCLC. Furthermore, cytoplasmic accumulation of Hepl was observed in a high metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines (H1299 and BE1), but not in low metastatic potential cell lines (LTE and A549). This study reveals that Hepl is overexpressed in the nucleus and aberrantly accumulates in the cytoplasm of NSCLC cells, and indicates that Hepl may play a role in the progression of lung cancer, including lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. Additionally, Hepl may be a useful prognostic factor in lung cancer.',\n",

PROCEDURES: SAR245408 was tested against the PPTP in vitro cell line  panel at concentrations from 10 to 100 microM and against the PPTP in vivo xenograft panels at a dose of 100 mg/kg administered orally daily x 14. RESULTS:  In vitro SAR245408 demonstrated cytotoxic activity, with a median relative IC50 value of 10.9 microM (range 2.7-24.5 microM). SAR245408 was well tolerated in vivo, and all 44 tested xenograft models were evaluable for efficacy. SAR245408 induced significant differences in EFS distribution compared to control in 29 of  37 (79%) of solid tumor xenografts and in two of seven (29%) ALL xenografts. SAR245408 induced tumor growth inhibition meeting criteria for intermediate EFS T/C activity (EFS T/C > 2) in 4 of 37 (11%) solid tumor xenografts. Intermediate  EFS T/C activity was also observed for two of seven (29%) evaluable ALL xenografts. Objective responses were not observed for solid tumor or for ALL xenografts.

Mean ADC value and mean metabolic ratio (MMR) were calculated within each benign sextant region or malignant region. The efficiency of these two indices in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis is estimated in Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the distinguishing capacity of mean ADC, MMR, and the combination of the two in differentiating between noncancerous and cancerous cases. RESULTS: There were significant differences for mean ADC value and MMR between malignant and benign regions. Weights of mean ADC  value obtained by FLDA were much higher than those of MMR. In differentiating malignant regions, both ADC alone and combined ADC and metabolic ratio performed  significantly better than MMR alone. However, accuracy improvements were not significant by using combined ADC and MMR than ADC alone. CONCLUSION: DWI is more efficient than MR spectroscopic (MRS) in the detection of PCa in this study.

CCS are also at increased risk for early mortality from cardiovascular (CV) disease, but the association between GH levels and CV risk remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to examine the cross-sectional association between stimulated GH levels and CV risk factors in CCS younger than 18 years. PROCEDURE: A total of 276 CCS (147 males, 14.4 +/- 2.6 years) >/=5 years after cancer diagnosis, and 208 sibling controls (112 males, 13.6 +/- 2.4 years) participated in this cross-sectional study, which included anthropometry, body composition, and metabolic studies. Blunted response (BR) was defined as peak GH level <7 microg/L after clonidine and arginine. Insulin sensitivity (M(lbm) ) was measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Statistical analyses used linear and logistic regression accounting for sibling clustering, adjusted for age, sex, Tanner stage, and adiposity. RESULTS: Thirty-four (12%) CCS showed BR to GH stimulation. BR CCS were shorter and had a  lower IGF-1 than controls; only 6 of 34 received cranial radiation therapy. CCS with normal stimulated GH response were similar to controls for CV risk factors.  Conversely, BR CCS had greater adiposity, higher lipids, and lower M(lbm) than controls. Differences in lipids and M(lbm) between BR CCS and controls remained significant after adjustment for BMI or visceral fat. CONCLUSIONS: BR to GH stimulation is prevalent in CCS youth and is associated with an unfavorable CV risk factor profile.

The majority of studies analyzing T cells and their relationship to colorectal tumor  growth have focused on individual T cell markers or gene clusters and thus the complexity of the T cell response contributing to the growth of the tumor is not  clear. We have studied the T cells in colorectal cancer patients and have defined a unique T cell signature for colorectal tumor tissue. Using a novel analytical flow cytometric approach in concert with confocal microscopy, we have shown that  the tumor has a lower frequency of effector T cells (CD69+), but a higher frequency of both regulatory (CD25hi Foxp3+) and inflammatory T cells (IL-17+) compared with associated nontransformed bowel tissue. We have also identified minor populations of T cells expressing conventional markers of both inflammatory and regulatory T cells (CD4+IL-17+Foxp3+) in the tumor tissue. These cells may represent intermediate populations or they may dictate an inflammatory versus regulatory function in surrounding T cells. Together, these data describe an immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer unique to the tumor tissue and distinct from the surrounding healthy bowel tissue, and this distinct environment is reflected by a gradient of T cells expressing markers of multiple T cell populations.

Using a regression model, we show that MYO1A mutations are likely to confer a growth advantage to gastric, but not endometrial tumors. The mutant MYO1A(7A) protein was shown to lose its membrane localization in gastric cancer cells and a cycloheximide-chase assay demonstrated that the mutant MYO1A(7A) protein has reduced stability compared to the wild type MYO1A. Frequent MYO1A promoter hypermethylation was also found in gastric tumors. Promoter methylation negatively correlates with MYO1A mRNA expression in a series of 58 non-MSI gastric primary tumors (Pearson's r = -0.46; p = 0.0003) but not in a cohort of 54 non-MSI endometrial tumors and treatment of gastric cancer cells showing high MYO1A promoter methylation with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, resulted in a significant increase of MYO1A mRNA levels.  We found that normal gastric epithelial cells, but not normal endometrial cells,  express high levels of MYO1A.

Exposure to light-at-night suppresses the nocturnal pineal melatonin synthesis, disrupting the circadian rhythm of GSK3beta phosphorylation. Melatonin activates GSK3beta by inhibiting the serine-threonine kinase Akt phosphorylation, inducing beta-catenin degradation and inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a fundamental process underlying cancer metastasis. Thus, chronic circadian disruption by light-at-night via occupational exposure or age-related sleep disturbances may contribute to cancer incidence and the metastatic spread of breast cancer by inhibiting GSK3beta activity and driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer patients.',\n",

IL-20 expression levels in tumorous and nontumorous oral tissue specimens from 40 patients with four different stages oral cancer were analyzed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Expression of IL-20 and its receptor subunits was higher in clinical oral tumor tissue than in nontumorous oral tissue. The role of IL-20 was examined in two oral cancer cell lines (OC-3 and OEC-M1). In vitro, IL-20 promoted TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, MCP-1, CCR4, and CXCR4 and increased proliferation, migration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and colony formation of oral cancer cells via activated STAT3 and AKT/JNK/ERK signals. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody 7E for treating oral cancer, an ex vivo tumor growth model was used. In vivo, 7E reduced tumor growth  and inflammation in oral cancer cells. In conclusion, IL-20 promoted oral tumor growth, migration, and tumor-associated inflammation.

The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the actual incidence of VAD-related  complications in cancer patients on HPN. METHODS: All adult cancer patient candidates for VAD insertion and HPN were enrolled. The incidence of complications associated with 4 types of VADs (peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC], Hohn catheter, tunneled Groshong catheter, and port) was investigated, as well as the most significant risk factors. RESULTS: Two hundred  eighty-nine VADs in 254 patients were studied, for a total of 51,308 catheter-days. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs)  was low (0.35/1000 catheter-days), particularly for PICCs (0/1000; P < .01 vs Hohn and tunneled catheters) and for ports (0.19/1000; P < .01 vs Hohn and P < .05 vs tunneled catheters). Mechanical complications were uncommon (0.8/1000), as was VAD-related venous thrombosis (0.06/1000). Ultrasound-guided venipuncture was associated with a decreased risk of CRBSI (P < .04) and thrombosis (P < .001). VAD securement using sutureless devices reduced the risk of CRBSI and dislocation (P < .001). Hohn catheters had no advantage over PICCs (higher complication rate  and shorter dwell time; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients, HPN can be safely carried out with a low incidence of complications. Also, VADs are not equal in terms of complication rates, and strict adherence to meticulous insertion policies may effectively reduce catheter-related complications.',\n",

This prospective feasibility study compared the efficacy of these two treatments in MBC. METHODS: Patients with MBC progressing following anthracycline treatment were randomly assigned to either docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)day 1 q3W) or vinorelbine (25mg/m(2) day 1 q2W). Patients were eligible to cross over at progression. Objective response rates (ORR), time  to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were measured. RESULTS: 37 patients were randomised. 2 patients were excluded due to protocol violations. Of 35 remaining patients 17 received docetaxel and 18 received vinorelbine per protocol. ORR was 12.5% and 6.0% respectively for docetaxel and vinorelbine. The  median time to progression was 10.4 weeks (range 6-14 weeks) in docetaxel arm and 7.6 weeks (range 4-11 weeks) in vinorelbine arm (p = .82). The clinical benefit rate (defined as complete response, partial response plus stable disease) was 44% in the docetaxel arm and 12% in the vinorelbine arm. Based on intent to treat the median OS in the docetaxel arm was 34 weeks (95% CI, 20.7-48) and 21.2 weeks (95% CI, 17-25.4) in vinorelbine arm (p = .388). 16 patients crossed over, 5 from docetaxel to vinorelbine and 11 from vinorelbine to docetaxel. At cross over the  ORR was 0% and 18% on cross over to vinorelbine and docetaxel respectively with a median TTP of 17.3 weeks (95% CI, 16.3-18.1) and 18.7 weeks (95% CI, 13.9-23.4) for those receiving vinorebine and docetaxel at cross over respectively. Vinorelbine however was much better tolerated with fewer grade 3-4 toxicity events (n = 4) than docetaxel (n = 27). DISCUSSION: While docetaxel resulted in a longer TTP and OS in this study it did not reach statistical significance. TTP duration for those patients who crossed over was similar, but overwhelmingly vinorelbine had fewer significant grade 3-4 toxicities than docetaxel. Only two previous randomized studies have compared the efficacy of single agent docetaxel  and vinorelbine following prior anthracycline exposure, one in an unselected population [16], and the other, HERNATA, in HER2 positive disease with trastuzumab used in both arms [17]. The patients randomized in this study were relatively heavily pretreated with the majority having received 2-3 lines of prior treatment for their metastatic disease. The lower response rates with vinorelbine as compared to docetaxel in this study concur with results reported in other studies [16]. However, the numbers in both this study and the other unselected study [16] are small and need to be interpreted with caution. With regard to toxicity, in the present study, grade 3-4 hematological adverse events  and infection were tenfold greater with docetaxel as compared with vinorelbine, consistent with results in HERNATA [17]. While others have reported a significantly higher number of overall grade 3-4 toxicities with vinorelbine [16], the fact that, as in HERNATA, discontinuations due to toxicities in that study [16] were significantly greater with docetaxel as compared to vinorelbine suggests either the toxicity data collected did not reflect the true toxicities on treatment or that docetaxel toxicities were in some way more severe or protracted leading to more numerous discontinuations [16]. Larger randomized studies are needed to determine (1) the efficacy of docetaxel versus vinorelbine  in anthracycline pretreated disease and (2) the efficacy of vinorelbine after prior taxane exposure, and particularly how it may compares both with regard to efficacy and tolerability with other possible regimens that may utilized such as  carboplatin-gemcitabine [20] or eribulin [21]. The longer as well as comparable TTP at cross over for both agents compared to that upfront suggests there may be  enrichment at cross over of a group of patients who are not only fit for further  treatment but are more likely to a derive continued benefit from additional treatment.',\n",

PURPOSE: To retrospectively compare the diagnostic value of full-dose, intravenously contrast-enhanced FDG-PET/CT and ultrasound for the detection of lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety patients (one patient with a bilateral carcinoma) (89 women, one man; mean age, 55.5 +/- 16.6 years) suffering from primary breast cancer underwent whole-body FDG-PET/CT and axillary ultrasound. The ipsilateral axillary fossa (n = 91) was evaluated for metastatic spread. The sensitivity, specificity, the positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of both methods were calculated. The sensitivity and accuracy were statistically compared using the McNemar Test (P <0.05). Analyses were made on a patient basis. The number of patients with extra-axillary locoregional lymph node metastases exclusively detected by FDG-PET/CT was evaluated. For axillary lymph node metastases histopathology served as the reference standard. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of FDG-PET/CT for the detection  of axillary lymph node metastases were 54%, 89%, 77%, 74%, and 75%, respectively. For ultrasound it was 38%, 78%, 54%, 65%, and 62%, respectively. FDG-PET/CT was significantly more accurate than ultrasound for the detection of axillary lymph node metastases (P = 0.019). There was no statistically significant difference between the sensitivity of both modalities (P = 0.0578). FDG-PET/CT detected extra-axillary locoregional lymph node metastases in seven patients (8%) that had not been detected by another imaging modality. CONCLUSION: Though more accurate compared to ultrasound for evaluating the axillary lymph node status FDG-PET/CT is only as sensitive as ultrasound when it comes to the detection of axillary lymph node metastases. Due to the low sensitivity FDG-PET/CT cannot act as a substitute for Sentinel lymph node biopsy. FDG-PET/CT is able to detect previously unknown locoregional extra-axillary lymph node metastases.',\n",

In normally grown cells, such intronic 5'SSs appear not to be selected for splicing. However, under heat shock conditions aberrant splicing involving such latent 5'SSs occurred in a number of specific gene transcripts. Using a splicing-sensitive microarray, we show here that stress-induced (e.g. heat shock) activation of latent splicing is widespread across the human transcriptome, thus highlighting the possibility that latent splicing may underlie certain diseases. Consistent with this notion, our analyses of data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) revealed widespread activation of  latent splicing in cells grown under hypoxia and in certain cancers such as breast cancer and gliomas. These changes were found in thousands of transcripts representing a wide variety of functional groups; among them are genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.

Here, we describe the identification of patient stratification biomarkers for NVP-BGJ398, a novel and selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor. By intersecting genome-wide gene expression and genomic alteration data with cell line-sensitivity data across an annotated collection of cancer cell lines called  the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, we show that genetic alterations for FGFR family members predict for sensitivity to NVP-BGJ398. For the first time, we report oncogenic FGFR1 amplification in osteosarcoma as a potential patient selection biomarker. Furthermore, we show that cancer cell lines harboring FGF19  copy number gain at the 11q13 amplicon are sensitive to NVP-BGJ398 only when concomitant expression of beta-klotho occurs. Thus, our findings provide the rationale for the clinical development of FGFR inhibitors in selected patients with cancer harboring tumors with the identified predictors of sensitivity. SIGNIFICANCE: The success of a personalized medicine approach using targeted therapies ultimately depends on being able to identify the patients who will benefit the most from any given drug. To this end, we have integrated the molecular profiles for more than 500 cancer cell lines with sensitivity data for  the novel anticancer drug NVP-BGJ398 and showed that FGFR genetic alterations are the most significant predictors for sensitivity.

Halofuginone is a plant alkaloid derivative that blocks TGF-beta signaling with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties. Here, we show for the first time that halofuginone therapy decreases development and progression of bone metastasis caused by melanoma cells through the inhibition of TGF-beta signaling. Halofuginone treatment of human melanoma cells inhibited cell proliferation, phosphorylation of SMAD proteins in response to TGF-beta, and TGF-beta-induced SMAD-driven transcription. In addition, halofuginone reduced expression of TGF-beta target genes that enhance bone metastases, including PTHrP, CTGF, CXCR4, and IL11. Also, cell apoptosis was increased in response to halofuginone. In nude mice inoculated with 1205 Lu melanoma cells, a preventive protocol with halofuginone inhibited bone metastasis. The beneficial effects of halofuginone treatment were comparable with those observed with other anti-TGF-beta strategies, including systemic administration of SD208, a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor I kinase, or forced overexpression  of Smad7, a negative regulator of TGF-beta signaling. Furthermore, mice with established bone metastases treated with halofuginone had significantly less osteolysis than mice receiving placebo assessed by radiography. Thus, halofuginone is also effective in reducing the progression of melanoma bone metastases. Moreover, halofuginone treatment reduced melanoma metastasis to the brain, showing the potential of this novel treatment against cancer metastasis.',\n",

The spheroid cells expressed cancer stem cell markers, showed the ability to differentiate, and induced tumors in mice. The spheroids were composed of cells that express various levels of CD44, whereas CD44(high) cells were associated with increased sphere-forming ability, expression of the activating form of beta-catenin, and elevated levels of glycolytic genes, CD44(-/low) cells showed increased levels of differentiation markers and apoptotic cells. The spheroid cells expressed variant forms of CD44 including v6, and the induction of the variants was associated with the activating phosphorylation of c-Met. As expected from the predicted hierarchy, CD44(high) cells differentiated into CD44(-/low) cells. Unexpectedly,  a fraction of CD44(-/low) cells generated CD44(high) cells, and the ROCK inhibitor or blebbistatin primed the transition by inducing CD44 expression.

Activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) endows invasive and metastatic properties upon cancer cells that favor successful colonization of distal target organs. The observation that in many cancers distant metastases resemble the epithelial phenotype of primary tumors has led to speculation that the disseminated tumor cells recruited to the  target organs undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). However, the MET cascade has not been recapitulated in vivo, and the cellular and molecular regulators that promote MET remain unknown. In a recent report, using a model of  spontaneous breast cancer, we have shown that bone marrow-derived myeloid progenitor cells in the premetastatic lung secrete the proteoglycan versican, which induces MET of metastatic tumor cells and accelerates metastases. This review summarizes recent progress in MET research, outlines a unique paracrine cross-talk between the microenvironment and the cancer cells, which promotes tumor outgrowth in the metastatic organ, and discusses opportunities for novel antimetastatic approaches for cancer therapy.',\n",

Such advances have shown bewildering intertumor heterogeneity with limited somatic alterations shared between tumors of the same histopathologic subtype. Exacerbating such complexity, increasing evidence of intratumor genetic heterogeneity (ITH) is emerging, both within individual tumor biopsies and spatially separated between biopsies of the same tumor. Sequential analysis of tumors has also revealed evidence that ITH temporally evolves during the disease  course. ITH has implications for predictive or prognostic biomarker strategies, where the tumor subclone that may ultimately influence therapeutic outcome may evade detection because of its absence or presence at low frequency at diagnosis  or because of its regional separation from the tumor biopsy site. In this review, the implications of \"trunk and branch\" tumor evolution for drug discovery approaches and emerging evidence that low-frequency somatic events may drive tumor growth through paracrine signaling fostering a tumor ecologic niche are discussed. The concept of an \"actionable mutation\" is considered within a model of clonal dominance and heterogeneous tumor cell dependencies. Evidence that cancer therapeutics may augment ITH and the need to track the tumor subclonal architecture through treatment are defined as key research areas. Finally, if combination therapeutic approaches to limit the consequences of ITH prove challenging, identification of drivers or suppressors of ITH may provide attractive therapeutic targets to limit tumor evolutionary rates and adaptation.',\n",

Analysis of published microarray data showed that AK4 was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma compared with normal cells. High AK4 expression was associated with advanced stage, disease recurrence and poor prognosis. Loss of AK4 expression suppressed the invasive potential of lung cancer cell lines, whereas AK4 overexpression promoted invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a pivotal regulatory target of AK4. Simultaneous reduction in AK4 and ATF3 expression abolished the inhibitory effects of ATF3 on invasion. ATF3 overexpression in AK4-overexpressing cells limits invasion activity. Furthermore, patients with high AK4 and low ATF3 expression showed unfavorable outcomes compared with patients with low AK4 and high ATF3 expression.

RESULTS: Overall completeness of the Austrian cancer incidence data 2005 was 94.2% after a registration period of 5 years. The flow method found striking  differences in completeness between the federal states, which are contrary to the time series analyses. CONCLUSION: Overall completeness of the Austrian National Cancer Registry is in concordance with estimates from international registries. The biggest part of the decrease of incidence rates in the past 2 published years seems to be a result of incompleteness.

Emerging evidence suggests that pharmacological modulation of autophagy is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer.

Recently, matrine has been reported to induce autophagy and autophagic cell death in cancer cells, although the underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Here, we systematically examined the autophagic events induced by matrine in SGC7901 cells. The accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in matrine-treated cells was verified by the conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 as well as confocal and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that matrine blocked autophagic degradation by impairing the activities of lysosomal proteases. Moreover, confocal microscopy and gradient ultracentrifugation revealed that the trafficking processes and proteolytic activation of cathepsins were inhibited by matrine. Using a pH sensor probe, we found elevated pH values in endosomes/lysosomes in response to matrine  treatment. Therefore, matrine seems to be a novel autophagy inhibitor that can modulate the maturation process of lysosomal proteases.',\n",

Using conditional logistic regression, we investigated these associations among 1584 incident CRC cases and  2516 sibling controls from the Colon Cancer Family Registry. Three IkappaBKbeta SNPs were associated with a statistically significant lower colorectal or colon cancer risk: rs9694958 (A>G intron 5) (colorectal: OR(hzv) = 0.26(0.07-0.99), P(trend) = 0.048, P(adj) = 0.25), rs10958713 (A>C intron 19) (colon: OR(hzv) = 0.62(0.42-0.92), P(trend) = 0.005, P(adj) = 0.03) and rs5029748 (C>A intron 2) (colon: OR(het) = 0.72(0.56-0.91), P(trend) = 0.01, P(adj) = 0.08).

We reiterate that potency differences for predominantly chrysotile- versus amphibole-asbestos-exposed cohorts are difficult to ascertain when meta-analyses  are restricted to studies with fewer exposure assessment limitations.

The aims of this study were to analyse the expression of DSCs and to evaluate their clinical application in lung cancer. METHODS: The expression of DSC1-3 mRNAs was analysed by RT-PCR. The methylation status of DSCs was analysed by demethylation tests and bisulphite sequencing. Protein expression of DSCs in primary lung cancer was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. RESULTS: DSC1-3 mRNAs were downregulated in lung cancer cells, and the expression was restored in four out of seven cell lines, respectively, after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. A heterogeneous methylation pattern was detected by bisulphite sequencing in exon 1 of DSC2 and DSC3. In 199 patients with primary lung cancer, we found that lower protein expression of DSC1 was significantly linked to worse tumour differentiation (p=0.017), DSC3 proteins were more expressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared with adenocarcinoma (ADC) (p<0.001), and reduced expression of DSC1 and DSC3 was significantly correlated with poor clinical outcome (p=0.045 and p=0.007, respectively).

Seven CRC cell lines were cultured and three human colon cancer cell lines, i.e., HCT116, SW480 and SW620, were used. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of RRM2, respectively. Cell proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis were performed. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by double staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) using Annexin V/PI apoptosis kit. The motility and invasion of CRC cells were assessed by the Transwell chamber assay. Cells were irradiated with a 254 nm UV-C lamp to detect the UV sensitivity after RRM2 depletion. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining revealed elevated RRM2 levels in CRC tissues. RRM2 overexpression was positively correlated with invasion depth (P < 0.05), poorly differentiated type (P = 0.0051), and tumor node metastasis stage (P = 0.0015). The expression of RRM2 in HCT116 cells was downregulated after transfection, and HCT116 cell proliferation was obviously suppressed compared to  control groups (P < 0.05). In the invasion test, the number of cells that passed  through the chambers in the RRM2-siRNA group was 81 +/- 3, which was lower than that in the negative control (289 +/- 7) and blank control groups (301 +/- 7.2).  These differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01). Our data suggest that RRM2 overexpression may be associated with CRC progression. RRM2 silencing by siRNA may inhibit the hyperplasia and invasiveness of CRC cells, suggesting that RRM2 may play an important role in the infiltration and metastasis of CRC, which is a potential therapeutic strategy in CRC. In addition, RRM2 depletion increased UV sensitivity. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that RRM2 may be a facilitating factor in colorectal tumorigenesis and UV-induced DNA damage repair.',\n",

METHODS: Of 145 patients who underwent a radical resection for gallbladder cancer from 1982 through 2006, 52 (36%) had an extended radical cholecystectomy, which involved en bloc resection of the gallbladder, gallbladder fossa, extrahepatic bile duct, and the regional lymph nodes (first- and second-echelon node groups). A retrospective analysis of the 52 patients was conducted including at least 5 years of follow up. Residual tumor status was judged as no residual tumor (R0) or microscopic/macroscopic residual tumor (R1-2). Pathological findings were documented according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging Manual (7th edition). RESULTS: The primary tumor was classified as pathological T1 (pT1) in 3 patients, pT2 in 36, pT3 in 12, and pT4 in 1. Twenty-three patients had lymph node metastases; 11 had a single positive node, 4 had two positive nodes, and 8 had three or more positive  nodes. None of the three patients with pT1 tumors had nodal disease, whereas 23 of 49 (47%) with pT2 or more advanced tumors had nodal disease. One patient died  during the hospital stay for definitive resection, giving an in-hospital mortality rate of 2%. Overall survival (OS) after extended radical cholecystectomy was 65% at 5 years and 53% at 10 years in all 52 patients. OS differed according to the pT classification (P < 0.001) and the nodal status (P = 0.010). All of 3 patients with pT1 tumors and most (29 of 36) patients with pT2 tumors survived for more than 5 years. Of 12 patients with pT3 tumors, 8 who had  an R1-2 resection, distant metastasis, or extensive extrahepatic organ involvement died soon after resection. Of the remaining four pT3 patients who had localized hepatic spread through the gallbladder fossa and underwent an R0 resection, 2 survived for more than 5 years and another survived for 4 years and  2 mo. The only patient with pT4 tumor died of disease soon after resection. Among 23 node-positive patients, 11 survived for more than 5 years, and of these, 10 had a modest degree of nodal disease (one or two positive nodes). CONCLUSION: Extended radical cholecystectomy is indicated for pT2 tumors and some pT3 tumors  with localized hepatic invasion, provided that the regional nodal disease is limited to a modest degree (up to two positive nodes). Extensive pT3 disease, pT4 disease, or marked nodal disease appears to be beyond the scope of this radical procedure.',\n",

METHODS: The tumor tissues of 115 patients with gastric cancer were immunohistochemically evaluated using monoclonal antibodies against NF-kappaB RelA. Preoperative serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) were assessed via enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A  (SAA) were measured via immunotrubidimetry. RESULTS: Positive rate of NF-kappaB RelA was 42.6%. NF-kappaB RelA expression in tumor tissues was also related to serum levels of IL-6 (P = 0.044) and CRP (P = 0.010). IL-6, SAA, CRP were related to depth of invasion, VEGF and SAA were correlated with lymph node metastasis. IL-6, VEGF, SAA and CRP were related to the stage. Univariate analysis demonstrated that immunostaining of NF-kappaB RelA, levels of IL-6, VEGF, SAA were significantly related with both disease free survival and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis verified that NF-kappaB RelA [hazard ratio (HR): 3.40, P = 0.024] and SAA (HR: 3.39, P = 0.045) were independently associated with OS.

METHODS: Out of 204 patients that underwent liver resection due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver specimens of 70 patients with HCC were evaluated for biliary components by  cytokeratin (CK) 19 immunostain (CK19(-) HCC and CK19(+) HCC). CK19 positivity was defined as membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression in >/= 5% of tumor cells  with moderate or strong intensity. Patients with other primary liver cancers, such as combined HCC and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) who received curative liver resection, were also included in the study. Clinical characteristics of CK19(-) HCC and CK19(+) HCC patients, including survival outcome after curative liver resection, were compared with that of cHCC-CC and ICC patients. RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) rate of CK19(-) HCC (n = 49) after the curative surgical treatment was 90.7%, and 80.4% at 1 and 5 years after the resection. OS rate of CK19(+) HCC (n  = 21) was 74.3%, 28.9% and OS rate of cHCC-CC (n = 22) was 66.7%, 32.2% at 1 and  5 years after the surgery. For ICC (n = 19), 1 and 5-year-OS rate was 50.2% and 14.3% after the curative resection. The OS rates of CK19(+) HCC and cHCC-CC were  significantly lower than that of CK19(-) HCC, but higher than the OS rate of ICC  (P = 0.000). There was no statistically significant difference in OS rate between CK19(+) HCC and cHCC-CC. The disease free survival (DFS) rate of CK19(-) HCC was  72.0% and 54.5% at 1 and 3 years after the surgical treatment. DFS rate of CK19(+) HCC was 53.3%, 34.3% and DFS rate of cHCC-CC was 51.5%, 39.2% at 1 and 3  years after the resection. For ICC, 1 and 3-year-DFS rate was 28.0% and 14.0% after the curative resection. DFS rate of CK19(-) HCC was significantly higher than that of ICC (P = 0.017), but marginally higher than DFS rate of either CK19(+) HCC or cHCC-CC (P = 0.097, P = 0.089, respectively). Predictors of outcome after the surgery of primary liver cancer were pathology of the resected  mass, existence of microvascular invasion and accompanying satellite nodule.

BC occur the most frequently in Asian and female populations. They are an important problem for pediatricians, gastroenterologists, radiologists and surgeons. Clinical presentation and management depend on the BC type. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most serious and dangerous BC complication. The other complications associated with BC involve cholelithiasis and hepatolithiasis, cholangitis, acute and chronic pancreatitis, portal hypertension, liver fibrosis and secondary liver cirrhosis and spontaneous cyst perforation. Different BC classifications have been described in the literature. Todani classification dividing BC into five types is the most useful in clinical practice. The early diagnosis and proper treatment are very important, because BC are associated with a risk of carcinogenesis. A malignancy risk increases with the age. Radiological investigations (ultrasonography, computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) play an important role in BC diagnostics. Currently, prenatal diagnosis using ultrasonography is possible. It allows to differentiate biliary disorders in fetals and to perform the early surgical treatment that improves results. In most patients, total cyst excision with Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy is the treatment of choice. Surgical treatment of BC is associated with high success rate and low morbidity and mortality. The early treatment is associated with a lower number of complications. Patients following BC surgery require permanent and careful postoperative observation using laboratory and imaging investigations because of  possibility of biliary anastomosis stricture and biliary cancer in tissue remnant.',\n",

METHODS: In order to determine whether there was a correlation between iNOS genotype and GC in Iran, we conducted a case-control study using samples from 329 individuals. For each sample, the C150T iNOS polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction digestion. Patients were grouped by cancer presence, demographic and  behavior characteristics, and H. pylori infection status. Statistical tests were  conducted to determine whether any behavioral factors or a particular iNOS genotype was associated with GC in the study population. RESULTS: In this population, we found that smoking, hot beverage consumption, a familial history of GC and H. pylori infection status were significantly associated with GC development (P = 0.015, P < 0.001, P = 0.0034, and P < 0.015, respectively). The  distribution of the C150T iNOS genotypes among the two study groups was not statistically significant alone, but was impacted by H. pylori infection status.  When compared to the non-H. pylori infected group, cancer patients who had a heterozygous CT genotype and were also infected with H. pylori were 2.1 times more at risk of developing GC [odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, P = 0.03] while those with  a homozygous TT genotype and infected with H. pylori were 5.0 times more at risk  of developing GC (OR = 5.0, P = 0.029). In contrast, this association was not seen in patients in the control group. CONCLUSION: A CT or TT polymorphism at position 150 in the iNOS gene significantly increases the risk of GC and may be a marker for GC susceptibility.',\n",

METHODS: The bone marrow of HCC mice was reconstructed by transplanting green fluorescent protein (GFP) + bone marrow cells. The concentration of circulating EPCs was determined by colony-forming assays and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Serum and tissue levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and colony-stimulating factor (CSF) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The distribution of EPCs in tumor and tumor-free tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The incorporation of EPCs into hepatic vessels was examined by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. The proportion of EPCs in vessels was then calculated. RESULTS: The HCC model was successful established. The flow cytometry analysis showed the mean percentage of CD133CD34 and CD133VEGFR2 double positive cells in  HCC mice was 0.45% +/- 0.16% and 0.20% +/- 0.09% respectively. These values are much higher than in the sham-operation group (0.11% +/- 0.13%, 0.05% +/- 0.11%, n = 9) at 14 d after modeling. At 21 d, the mean percentage of circulating CD133CD34 and CD133VEGFR2 cells is 0.23% +/- 0.19%, 0.25% +/- 0.15% in HCC model  vs 0.05% +/- 0.04%, 0.12% +/- 0.11% in control. Compared to the transient increase observed in controls, the higher level of circulating EPCs were induced  by HCC. In addition, the level of serum VEGF and CSF increased gradually in HCC,  reaching its peak 14 d after modeling, then slowly decreased. Consecutive sections stained for the CD133 and CD34 antigens showed that the CD133+ and CD34+ VEGFR2 cells were mostly recruited to HCC tissue and concentrated in tumor microvessels. Under fluorescence microscopy, the bone-marrow (BM)-derived cells labeled with GFP were concentrated in the same area. The relative levels of CD133 and CD34 gene expression were elevated in tumors, around 5.0 and 3.8 times that of the tumor free area. In frozen liver sections from HCC mice, cells co-expressing CD133 and VEGFR2 were identified by immunohistochemical staining using anti-CD133 and VEGFR2 antibodies. In tumor tissue, the double-positive cells were incorporated into vessel walls. In immunofluorescent staining. These CD31 and GFP double positive cells are direct evidence that tumor vascular endothelial cells (VECs) come partly from BM-derived EPCs. The proportion of GFP  CD31 double positive VECs (out of all VECs) on day 21 was around 35.3% +/- 21.2%. This is much higher than the value recorded on day 7 group (17.1% +/- 8.9%). The  expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular adhesion molecule 1, and VEGF was higher in tumor areas than in tumor-free tissues. CONCLUSION: Mobilized EPCs were found to participate in tumor vasculogenesis of HCC. Inhibiting EPC mobilization or recruitment to tumor tissue may be an efficient strategy for treating HCC.',\n",

Inclusion was limited to high-quality randomized clinical trials. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included in the present analysis, with a total of 8808 patients recruited. The studies were divided into four subgroups based on the different kinds of cytotoxic agents, including platinum, fluoropyrimidine, camptothecin and targeted agents.

In addition, LA normalized oxidative stress in liver of mice-bearing EAC cells evidenced by increasing the levels of total thiols, glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalyse. On the other hand, significant decreases in the levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were demonstrated in liver indicating controlled oxidative stress in these animals. As a consequence, LA regulated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase.

Since 1859, several devices have been developed for voice restoration, based mainly on a vibrating reed element. However, the resulting sound is very monotonous and thus  unpleasant. Presently the most successful way of voice restoration is the placement of a one-way shunt valve in the tracheo-esophageal wall, thus preventing aspiration and allowing air to flow from the lungs to the esophagus, where soft tissues start to vibrate for substitute voicing. However, the quality  of this voice is often poor. New artificial vocal folds to be placed within the shunt valve have been developed, and a membrane-principle concept appears very promising, owing to the self-cleaning construction and the high voice quality.

Based on histopathology and molecular genetic alterations, ovarian carcinomas are divided into five main types [high-grade serous (70%), endometrioid (10%), clear-cell (10%), mucinous (3%), and low-grade serous carcinomas (<5%)] that account for over 95% of cases.  These types are essentially distinct diseases, as indicated by differences in epidemiological and genetic risk factors, precursor lesions, patterns of spread,  and molecular events during oncogenesis, response to chemotherapy, and prognosis. For a successful specific treatment, reproducible histopathological diagnosis of  the tumor cell type is critical. The five tumor types are morphologically diverse and resemble carcinomas of the uterus. Actually, recent investigations have demonstrated that a substantial number of cancers, traditionally thought to be primary ovarian tumors (particularly serous, endometrioid, and clear-cell carcinomas), originate in the fallopian tube and the endometrium and involve the  ovary secondarily. This presentation summarizes recent advances in the molecular  pathology which have greatly improved our understanding of the biology of ovarian carcinoma and are also relevant to patient management.',\n",

Relapse occurs following the three main types of treatment, surgery with or without post-operative (chemo)radiotherapy, or chemoradiation (containing cisplatin).

At this moment, clinical staging is not enough to identify patients who will develop relapse and who need  tailored treatment. This review describes the latest knowledge of mechanisms of cancer relapse, addresses the biomarkers of potential interest detectable in the  tissue of the tumour or its surgical margins and discusses three biomarkers, human papillomavirus, TP53 and epidermal growth receptor in more detail.

The aim of diagnostic work-up in CUP is to classify as specifically as possible the cancer affecting the patient, according to the broad tumour type, subtype and, where possible, site of origin. This classification currently best predicts patient outcome and guides optimal treatment. a stepwise approach to diagnostic work-up is described. although pathology is based on morphology, the assessment of tissue-specific genes through immunohistochemistry (IHC) substantially helps tumour classification at each diagnostic step. For IHC in CUP, recent improvements include more standardised approaches and marker panels plus new markers. Tissue-specific genes are also being used in CUP work-up through molecular profiling. Large-scale profiles of hundreds of tumours of different types have been generated, compared and used to generate diagnostic algorithms. Commercial tests for CUP classification have been developed at the mRNa and microRNA and (miRNA) levels and validated in metastatic tumours and CUPs. While currently optimal pathology and IHC remain the 'gold standard' for CUP diagnostic work-up, and full clinical correlation is vital, the molecular tests appear to perform well: in the main diagnostic challenge of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated tumours, molecular profiling performs as well as or better than IHC.\",\n",

ESA safety issues include thromboembolic events  and there have been concerns about disease progression and/or mortality in cancer patients. This educational supplement paper is based on two recently published papers. We review both clinical trial data on ESAs and disease progression and preclinical data on how ESAs could affect tumour growth. We conclude that ESAs may have little effect on disease progression in chemotherapy patients, and preclinical data indicate a direct or indirect effect of ESAs on tumour growth is not strongly supported. We also summarise the mechanisms and clinical consequences of iron deficiency and anaemia in cancer patients. Randomised clinical trials have shown superior efficacy of i.v. iron over oral or no iron in reducing blood transfusions, increasing haemoglobin, and improving quality of life in ESA-treated anaemic advanced cancer patients. Furthermore, i.v. iron without additional ESA should be evaluated as potential treatment in patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia. at recommended doses, i.v. iron is well tolerated, particularly compared with oral iron, but caution should be used in some specific situations.',\n",

Several expert groups and medical societies have assessed the data and concluded  that LDCT screening for lung cancer is, however, not ready for large-scale population-based implementation. Too many open questions remain, such as definition of the at-risk population, timing and intervals of screening, optimal  method of acquisition and interpretation of the images, how to handle (false) positive findings, and especially cost-effectiveness in relation to other lung cancer prevention strategies, mainly smoking cessation. Further analyses and several ongoing European trials are eagerly awaited. Much hope also resides in the use of biomarkers, as their use in, e.g., blood or exhaled air may provide more easy-to-use tests to better stratify high-risk populations for screening studies. While exciting research is ongoing in this domain--e.g. with microRNAs--none of the tests has yet reached sufficient validation for clinical use.

Using the sensitive assay of MSP, we explored the promoter methylation status for the three genes in tumor specimens and urine sediment DNA from 32 bladder cancer patients. Methylation frequencies of the tested genes in tumor specimens were 100%, 75% and 84.4% for APC, RAR&#946; and Survivin, respectively. Hypermethylation of APC was found in all pathological grades and stages of bladder cancer. More frequent promoter hypermethylation of RAR&#946; and Survivin was observed in high grade tumors and  the hypermethylation increased from low to high stages, but there was no significant correlation between stages/grades and hypermethylation of these two gene promoters. In order to investigate clinical usefulness for noninvasive bladder cancer detection, we further analyzed the methylation status in urine samples of bladder cancer patients. Methylation of the tested genes in urine sediment DNA was detected in the majority of cases that were hypermethylated in tumor samples (93.7%) and the frequencies were 79.3% 70.8% and 96.3% for APC, RAR&#946; and Survivin, respectively. Our results indicate that methylation of APC, RAR&#946; and Survivin gene promoters is a common finding in patients with bladder carcinoma.

Breast cancer incidences stratified on histological subtypes were obtained from the national cancer registries. HT sales data from drug consumption statistics and information on the county-level introduction of mammography screening were combined, and breast cancer incidence trends were estimated using Poisson regression models, focusing on the period after 2002. From 2002 to 2007 the annual decrease in breast cancer incidence rates for women  aged 50-69 was 1.5% (95% CI -2.3% to -0.7%) in Sweden and 0.8% (95% CI -2.8% to 1.2%) in the part of Norway not confounded by prevalence screening. Most of the decline was in the rates of ILC which dropped by 4.7% (95% CI -6.6% to -2.7%) and 7.0% (95% CI -12.8% to -0.9%) per year, respectively. The rates of IDC were stable in this period. Breast cancer incidence has declined in Sweden and Norway  since 2002, but the reduction is moderate compared with the large increase that occurred during the introduction of mammography screening.

Previous reports in breast cancer generally analyzed one to three positive axillary nodes as a single group. This study investigates whether  one to three positive axillary nodes is a homogeneous group in prognosis by comparing one to two positive nodes to three positive nodes. The population-based registry of a Canadian province from 1981 through 1995 was searched. As the reliability of nodal assessment depends on the number of nodes sampled, we also studied the subgroup of patients with greater than or equal to eight nodes dissected. Of a total of 5,996 breast cancer patients, 1187 had one to three positive axillary nodes. The 263 patients with three positive nodes compared to the 924 patients with one to two nodes fared worse with a significantly reduced cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Patients with one to two positive nodes had similar CSS (p=0.31) and OS (p=0.63). Among those with greater than or equal to eight nodes dissected, there were 677 patients with one to two positive nodes. CSS and OS were not significantly different between one versus two positive nodes (p=0.16 and 0.34, respectively), but with NR, the corresponding p values were 0.0068 and 0.08, respectively. The cutoff value of NR 0.15 was found to be most useful and confirmed by the validation dataset. NR is able to segregate patients better than the absolute number of positive nodes used in the current staging system. NR should be incorporated into the staging system.',\n",

Imidazoline structure has been one of the most sought-after scaffolds employed in developing various agents with different kinds of pharmacological activities. During 2006 - 2012, imidazoline structures have been found in numerous patented compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

Our goal was to investigate the effect of silencing STAT3 on ovarian cancer cell apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis and expression of key targets  in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The ovarian cancer cell lines A2780CP and A2780s were used. STAT3 was knocked down by the plasmid-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA)  expression system. In vitro, a colony formation assay and Hoechst staining were used to examine cell proliferation and apoptosis. The expression level of STAT3 and apoptosis-related proteins were determined by Western blot. The A2780CP intraperitoneal model was used to evaluate the effect of shSTAT3 on tumor growth  in mice. Proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in tumor tissues were measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen, TUNEL and CD31 immunostaining, respectively. RESULTS: Treatment with shSTAT3 resulted in apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro. Western blot analysis demonstrated that shSTAT3 induced the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and reduced the expression of survivin, Bcl-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor. In vivo, the tumor weight was reduced to 13.46% of 5% glucose by shSTAT3/lipoplexes (P < 0.01), accompanied with apoptosis induction (P < 0.01), proliferation inhibition  (P < 0.01) and angiogenesis inhibition (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We find that treatment with shSTAT3 inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. This work should provide the scientific foundation for future investigation of shSTAT3 as a strategy for ovarian cancer gene therapy and the combination of gene therapy with chemotherapy.',\n",

As p16(INK4a) and Ki-67 co-expression clearly indicates deregulation of the cell cycle, the aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 dual labelling in urinary cytology samples. METHODS: Immunolabelling was performed in demounted, destained Papanicolaou slides after ThinPrep((R)) processing. A total of 84 urinary cytology samples (18 negative, 10 low grade, 19 atypical urothelial cells and 37  high grade) were analysed for p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression. We assessed underlying urothelial malignancy with cystoscopy, histopathology and follow-up data in every case. RESULTS: Compared with raw histopathological results, p16 (INK4a) /Ki-67 dual labelling was observed in 48 out of 55 (87.3%) HG lesions and in 11 out of 29 (37.9%) negative, papillary urothelial neoplasia of low malignant potential or low-grade carcinomas (P = 0.05). All cases with high-grade/malignant cytology were dual labelled. Sixteen out of 17 (94.1%) carcinoma in situ cases and eight out of 14 (57.1%) cases with atypical urothelial cells matching with HG lesions were dual labelled. Extended follow-up allowed three cases of progression to be diagnosed in dual-labelled cases with negative/low-grade cytology results after a 9- to 11-months delay. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that p16(INK4a) /Ki-67  co-expression allows most HG cancer cells to be detected initially and in the follow-up period. Additional studies are needed in order to determine whether dual labelling can be used as a triage tool for atypical urothelial cells in the  urine.',\n",

Its success hinges on achieving reliably negative histologic margins. When assessing margins, Mohs surgeons generally examine multiple histologic sections per Mohs stage. In some cases, the most-peripheral section or sections are clear, but tumor is identified in deeper sections within  the same tissue block. OBJECTIVE: To explore approaches to margin analysis in these scenarios. METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to members of the American College of Mohs Surgery investigating their standard practice when definitively tumor-free section(s) are examined during a Mohs stage before finding cancer in a deep section. Factors influencing the decision were explored. RESULTS: The number of clear sections required to declare margin negativity and terminate MMS (margin threshold) varied widely among respondents; 25% were comfortable with one clear section, whereas 19% would obtain an additional layer  with eight clear sections. Margin thresholds depended on tumor type but were independent of surgeon experience. CONCLUSION: Although no consensus emerged, a majority of respondents would not take an additional layer with four clear sections if resecting basal cell carcinoma.

AIM: To assess the quality of life of patients with severe heart failure and its correlation with patient demographic, socio-economic and clinical characteristics. METHOD: We studied 199 patients with heart failure who were hospitalized in the Cardiology Department of three general hospitals of Greece during a 1-year period. Demographic and socio-economic data were obtained using a short questionnaire, while clinical data were obtained from medical record review. The assessment of the patients' quality of life was performed using Minnesota Life with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ). FINDINGS: The mean MLWHFQ score was 62.7 (+/-20.3). Significantly lower quality of life was found in patients with diabetes mellitus (Coefficient beta (beta)=11.4; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 5.2-17.5), hypertension (beta=10.3; CI, 1.4-19.1), chronic renal failure (beta=13.9; CI, 5.9-21.9), chronic respiratory failure (beta=11.2; CI, 4.7-17.7), cancer (beta=12.3; CI, 2.3-22.4), psychiatric disease (beta=10.5; CI,  0.6-20.4) and those patients who were classified in New York Heart Association class IV (beta=10.6, CI=4.1-17.0). CONCLUSIONS: The average score of the MLWHFQ was high, and this reflects the poor quality of life of patients. Higher scores in specific patient groups show the negative influence of these factors in quality of life.

N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc)-containing gangliosides have been detected in some neoplasms in humans, although they are usually absent in normal human tissues. Our aim was to evaluate the presence of NeuGc-containing gangliosides including GM3 (NeuGc) and assess their relationship with the prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NeuGc-containing ganglioside expression in NSCLC tissues was analyzed immunohistochemically using the mouse monoclonal antibody GMR8, which is specific for gangliosides with NeuGc alpha 2,3Gal-terminal structures. On the basis of NeuGc-containing ganglioside expression, we performed survival analysis. We also investigated the differences  in the effects of GM3 (N-acetylneuraminic acid [NeuAc]) and GM3 (NeuGc) on inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in A431 cells. As a result, the presence of NeuGc-containing gangliosides was evident in  86 of 93 (93.5%) NSCLC samples. The NSCLC patients with high NeuGc-containing ganglioside expression had a low overall survival rate and a significantly low progression-free survival rate. In the in vitro study, the inhibitory effect of GM3 on EGFR tyrosine kinase in A431 cells after exposure to GM3 (NeuGc) was lower than that after exposure to GM3 (NeuAc). In conclusion, NeuGc-containing gangliosides including GM3 (NeuGc) are widely expressed in NSCLC, and NeuGc-containing ganglioside expression is associated with patient survival. The  difference in the effects of GM3 (NeuGc) and GM3 (NeuAc) on the inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase might contribute to improvement in the prognosis of NSCLC patients.',\n",

This study aimed at examining the short- and long-term follow-up results of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery for colorectal cancer and at investigating clinical outcomes, oncologic safety, and any potential advantages of laparoscopic colorectal cancer  resection. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a database containing the information about patients who underwent surgery for stage I-III colorectal cancer from January 2004 to January 2012 at our institution. RESULTS:  The patients who underwent the laparoscopic-assisted procedure showed a significantly faster recovery than those who underwent open surgery, namely, less time to first passing flatus (P=.041), time of first bowel motion (P=.04), time to resume normal diet (P=.043), and time to walk independently (P=.031). Laparoscopic colorectal surgery caused less pain for patients, leading to lower need of analgesic (P=.002) and less hospital recovery time (P=.034), compared with patients who underwent open surgery. No differences were found in 3- and 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the laparoscopic approach was as safe as the open alternative.

The natural history of prostate cancer is unique both because of extensive pre-treatment screening and the ease of post-treatment monitoring for recurrence. Using available predictive  models for prostate cancer recurrence, we examine whether current evidence supports a prolonged waiting period after radical prostatectomy and before renal  transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MedLine search was conducted to identify five series (published between 2000 and 2011), which examined biochemical recurrence (BCR) after prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer. The likelihood of BCR at one, two, and five yr after radical prostatectomy was identified for each series. RESULTS: Each of the analyzed series demonstrated that the likelihood of BCR after radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer was identical at one, two, and five yr and did not exceed 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of BCR does not increase during the first five yr after radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer. Additionally, the risk of recurrence  approaches zero during this period. Therefore, current evidence does not support  the mandated waiting period of five yr before organ transplantation.',\n",

However, the potency of microtubule inhibitors used clinically is limited by the emergence of resistance. We thus designed a strategy to find new cell-permeable microtubule-targeting agents. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using a cell-based assay designed to probe for microtubule polymerization status, we screened a chemical library and identified two azaindole derivatives, CM01 and CM02, as cell-permeable microtubule-depolymerizing agents. The mechanism of the anti-tumour effects of these two compounds was further investigated both in vivo  and in vitro. KEY RESULTS: CM01 and CM02 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and exerted potent cytostatic effects on several cancer cell lines including multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines. In vitro experiments revealed that the azaindole derivatives inhibited tubulin polymerization and competed with colchicines for this effect, strongly indicating that tubulin is the cellular target of these azaindole derivatives. In vivo experiments, using a chicken chorioallantoic xenograft tumour assay, established that these compounds exert a  potent anti-tumour effect. Furthermore, an assay probing the growth of vessels out of endothelial cell spheroids showed that CM01 and CM02 exert anti-angiogenic activities. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: CM01 and CM02 are reversible microtubule-depolymerizing agents that exert potent cytostatic effects on human cancer cells of diverse origins, including MDR cells. They were also shown to inhibit angiogenesis and tumour growth in chorioallantoic breast cancer xenografts. Hence, these azaindole derivatives are attractive candidates for further preclinical investigations.',\n",

CD147 is a tumour-associated antigen that plays a key regulatory role for MMP activities. In the present study, mass spectrum analysis demonstrated that the purified native CD147 from human lung cancer tissue was N-glycosylated and contained a series of high-mannose and complex-type N-linked glycan structures. Moreover, native glycosylated CD147 existed exclusively as oligomers in solution and directly stimulated MMP production more efficiently than non-glycosylated prokaryotic CD147. The glycosylation site mutation results indicated that, among three N-glycan attachment sites, the N152Q mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and unfolded protein response signalling was activated. This improper intracellular accumulation impaired its MMP-inducing activity. Increased beta1,6-branching of N-glycans as a result of overexpression of GnT-V (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V) plays an important role in tumour metastasis. In the present study, we identified CD147 as a target protein of GnT-V and found  that overexpression of GnT-V resulted in an elevated level of CD147 at the plasma membrane and in cell-conditioned medium, thereby increasing the induction of MMPs. The present study reveals the important role of N-glycosylation of CD147 in its biological function and implied that targeting aberrant beta1,6-branching of  N-glycans on CD147 would be valuable for the development of novel therapeutic modalities against carcinoma.',\n",

We therefore examined the association between sleep duration and all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and conducted stratified analysis based on physical function and self-rated health. This study used prospective data from the Ohsaki  Cohort Study, conducted in Miyagi Prefecture, in northern Japan. This study population comprised 49 256 subjects aged 40-79 years at the baseline survey. We  estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause and cause-specific mortality according to the five categories of sleep duration (</=6, 7, 8, 9, >/=10 h day(-1) ), treating 7 h as the reference group, employing Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. We found that long sleep duration  was associated with mortality. The HRs (95% CIs) of subjects who slept more than  10 h were 1.37 (1.27-1.47), 1.49 (1.30-1.71) and 1.53 (1.36-1.73) for mortality due to all causes, total cardiovascular disease and other causes of death mortality, respectively. The association between long sleep duration and stroke mortality was especially marked among subjects with limited physical function and poorer health status. However, we did not observe such a trend for mortality due  to all causes, total cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, cancer or other causes of death.

Recent progress in cancer stem-like cell/cancer-initiating cell (CSC/CIC) research indicates that CSCs are related to metastasis. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 - (ALDH1) and SRY-related HMG-box gene 2 (SOX2) have recently been shown to be putative CSC markers for several human malignancies. The aim of this study was to determine the association of ALDH1 and SOX2 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with lymph node metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining of ALDH1, SOX2 and Ki67 was performed in 80 OSCC tissues. High expression rates of ALDH1 (2%-40%) were found to be related to lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0017). Interestingly, we found that SOX2 staining could be classified into two patterns: (i) peripheral staining pattern; and (ii)  diffuse staining pattern. The diffuse staining pattern showed a significant correlation with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001). No correlation was found between Ki67 staining and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.4724). The ALDH1 positive  staining rates in metastatic lymph nodes were higher than that in corresponding primary OSCC tissues. These results indicate that high expression rates of ALDH1  and SOX2 diffuse staining patterns might be novel prediction markers for OSCC lymph node metastasis.',\n",

METHODS: Electronic searches of PubMed and EMBASE were conducted to select studies for this meta-analysis. The principal outcome measure was the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of CRC associated with  four VEGF (-460T/C, -634G/C, +936C/T, and -2578C/A) gene polymorphisms. RESULTS:  We identified 12 epidemiologic studies, which included 2770 CRC cases and 2568 controls.

There was  also a significant difference in the BRCA1 promoter methylation levels between different ovarian cancer stages. Compared to stage I and the control groups, there were higher BRCA1 promoter methylation frequencies in stage II and III ovarian cancers. BRCA1 methylation correlated with the loss of BRCA1 expression.  BRCA1 promoter in stage I tumors showed hypomethylated.

Few studies have robustly explored the full model. This study aimed to do so within the context of a major life event: cancer diagnosis. DESIGN: A repeated measures design was used whereby data were collected using self-report questionnaire at baseline (soon after diagnosis), and 3- and 6-month follow-up. METHODS: A total of 160 recently  diagnosed cancer patients were recruited (mean time since diagnosis = 46 days). Their mean age was 64.2 years. Data on appraisals, core-relational themes, and emotions were collected. Data were analysed using both Spearman's correlation tests and multivariate regression modelling. RESULTS: Longitudinal analysis demonstrated weak correlation between change scores of theoretically associated components and some emotions correlated more strongly with cognitions contradicting theoretical expectations. Cross-sectional multivariate testing of the ability of cognitions to explain variance in emotion was largely theory inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Although data support the generic structure of the Transactional Model, they question the model specifics. Larger scale research is  needed encompassing a wider range of emotions and using more complex statistical  testing. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT?: * Stress processes are transactional and coping outcome is informed by both cognitive appraisal of the stressor and the individual's emotional response (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). * Lazarus (1999) made specific hypotheses about which  particular stress appraisals would determine which emotional response, but only a small number of these relationships have been robustly investigated. * Previous empirical testing of this theory has been limited by design and statistical limitations. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: * This study empirically investigates the cognitive precedents of a much larger range of emotional outcomes than has previously been attempted in the literature. * Support for the model at a general level is established: this study demonstrates that both primary and secondary appraisals, and core-relational themes are important variables in explaining variance in emotional outcome. * The specific hypotheses proposed by Lazarus (1999) are not, however, supported: using data-driven approaches we demonstrate that equally high levels of variance can be explained using entirely different cognitive appraisals than those hypothesized.\",\n",

METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010, 106 patients with locally advanced cancer of the  middle and lower rectum were admitted to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy either with (n = 61) or without (n = 45) regional hyperthermia. A retrospective comparison was performed between two groups: 45 patients received standard treatment consisting of 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to the pelvis and 5-fluorouracil (RCT group) and 61 patients received the same treatment in combination with regional hyperthermia (HRCT group). Target temperature was 40.5 degrees C for at  least 60 min. Total mesorectal excision was performed routinely. RESULTS: pCR was seen in 6.7% of patients in the RCT group and 16.4% in the HRCT group. Patients who received at least four hyperthermia treatments (n = 40) achieved a significantly higher pCR rate (22.5%) than the remaining 66 patients (p = 0.043). Rates of sphincter-sparing surgery were similar in both groups with 64% in the RCT group and 66% in HRCT. When considering only low-lying tumours located within 8 cm of the anal verge prior to treatment, the rate of sphincter-sparing surgery  was 57% in the HRCT group compared with 35% in the RCT group (p = 0.077). CONCLUSION: The combination of regional hyperthermia and neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy may lead to an increased pCR rate in locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients with low-lying tumours especially may benefit when additional downsizing allows sphincter-preserving surgery.',\n",

This exploratory study sought to understand why patients dying of cancer in oncology wards of one hospital trust were, or were not, supported by the LCP. A purposive  qualitative case study design was used; each case represented a patient who had died and their most involved nurse and doctor. In-depth interviews explored both  recollections of the 'case' and wider experiences of using the Pathway in end-of-life care. Eleven healthcare professionals were interviewed about their involvement in the end-of-life care of six patients. For four of these patients care was supported by the LCP. FINDINGS: Although doctors and nurses reported they preferred to use the Pathway to ensure comfortable death, an important factor influencing their decisions was time of death. Access to timely senior review was regarded as an essential preliminary to placing patients on the Pathway but delayed access 'out of hours' was commonly experienced and tensions arose from balancing conflicting priorities. Consequently, the needs of dying patients sometimes failed to compete with those receiving curative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that greater attention should be focused on 'out of hours' care in hospitals to ensure regular senior review of all patients at risk of dying and to support front line staff to communicate effectively and make contingency plans focused on patients' best interests.\",\n",

Illness perceptions and coping at baseline and changes in these variables over time served as possible predictors of distress at two follow-up points. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-seven women with breast cancer who participated in a psychosocial aftercare programme completed a questionnaire before the start of the intervention, directly after the end of the intervention, and 1 year after the start of the intervention. Study variables were assessed with the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (illness perceptions), the COPE (coping), and the Hopkins Symptom Check List (distress). RESULTS: Results showed that 43% of variance in distress at baseline was explained by participants' illness perceptions. Cyclical timeline perceptions were the strongest predictor of distress at baseline. Longitudinal data revealed that after the end of the intervention, the intensity of general distress and breast cancer-related emotions had decreased significantly. Partial correlations showed that baseline illness perceptions were unrelated to distress at follow-up. However, changes in  illness perceptions (perceptions about the cyclical and chronic timeline and symptoms associated with breast cancer) showed significant associations with distress at both follow-up assessments. Associations of follow-up distress with coping styles were less consistent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that changes in illness perceptions are related to an improvement or worsening of patients' emotional well-being over time. These findings hold promise for the development of interventions that specifically target patients' representations of their illness.\",\n",

METHODS: Immunohistochemical  staining for GOLPH3 was performed on tissue microarrays of 342 prostate patients. The correlation between GOLPH3 expression with its clinicopathologic factors was  also analyzed in order to determine its prognostic significance. RESULTS: GOLPH3  expression of normal prostate tissues, benign prostate hyperplasia, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and hormone-dependent prostate cancer (HDPC) did not show any statistically significant difference. In contrast, statistically significant difference was reported in moderate/intense GOLPH3 expression in cases diagnosed with HDPC and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (P < 0.0005). Moderate /intense expression of GOLPH3 was associated with androgen independence (P = 0.012), higher Gleason score (P = 0.017), bone metastasis (P =  0.024), higher baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (P = 0.038), and higher PSA nadir (P = 0.032). A significantly negative correlation was found between moderate/intense GOLPH3 expression and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 0.28, P  = 0.012) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.42, P = 0.027). Univariated analysis indicated that moderate/intense GOLPH3 expression created a significantly prognostic impact in patients with CRPC. On the other hand, multivariate analysis indicated that GOLPH3 was a significantly independent prognostic factor of DFS (P = 0.027) in all prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was discovered that the overexpression of GOLPH3 is associated with the transition of prostate cancer from hormone sensitive phase to hormone refractory phase. GOLPH3  might be an important prognostic factor of DFS and OS in patients with prostate cancer. In totality, GOLPH3 could be used as a novel candidate in devising a more effective therapeutic strategy to tackle CRPC.

However, in cancer cells, these feedback loops are overridden through unclear mechanisms to sustain oncogenic activation of NF-kappaB signaling. Previously, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-30e* directly represses IkappaBalpha expression and leads to hyperactivation  of NF-kappaB. Here, we report that miR-182 was overexpressed in a different set of gliomas with relatively lower miR-30e* expression and that miR-182 directly suppressed cylindromatosis (CYLD), an NF-kappaB negative regulator. This suppression of CYLD promoted ubiquitin conjugation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway components and induction of an aggressive phenotype of glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that TGF-beta induced miR-182 expression, leading to prolonged NF-kappaB activation. Importantly, the results of these experiments were consistent with an identified significant correlation between miR-182 levels with TGF-beta hyperactivation and activated NF-kappaB in a cohort  of human glioma specimens. These findings uncover a plausible mechanism for sustained NF-kappaB activation in malignant gliomas and may suggest a new target  for clinical intervention in human cancer.',\n",

METHODS: In this study, 111 patients with gastric cancer who consecutively underwent MDCT scan followed by radical surgical treatment at our hospital were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 3632 lymph nodes from 643 lymphatic stations were studied and then correlated with radiological features. Lymph-node size was not always associated with infiltration. Of the 261 lymph-node stations that were not radiologically detected, 60 (22.9%) were infiltrated. There were 108 stations with lymph nodes larger than 10 mm seen on MDCT, of which 67 (62%) had lymphatic invasion. The sensitivity was 32.6%, specificity 90.6%, positive predictive value 62.0%, negative predictive value 74.2%, and accuracy 72.1%. When three lymph nodes, at least one of which was larger than 10 mm, were detected in the same station, infiltration was confirmed with 99% specificity in 93.8% of patients. Moreover, all of the 13 patients in whom three lymph nodes larger than 10 mm were detected  in different neighboring stations had lymphatic invasion.

In order to identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that might contribute to taxane response, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for two taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, using 276 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), followed by genotyping of top candidate SNPs in 874 lung cancer patient samples treated with paclitaxel. METHODS: GWAS was performed using 1.3 million SNPs and taxane cytotoxicity IC50 values for 276 LCLs. The association of selected SNPs with overall survival in 76 small or 798 non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC, NSCLC) patients were analyzed by Cox regression model, followed by integrated SNP-microRNA-expression association analysis in LCLs and siRNA screening of candidate genes in SCLC (H196) and NSCLC (A549) cell lines. RESULTS: 147 and 180  SNPs were associated with paclitaxel or docetaxel IC50s with p-values <10-4 in the LCLs, respectively. Genotyping of 153 candidate SNPs in 874 lung cancer patient samples identified 8 SNPs (p-value < 0.05) associated with either SCLC or NSCLC patient overall survival.

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization, was analyzed using a Cox model, stratified for the tumor response at the end of induction therapy, at a one-sided alpha of 0.2. Secondary endpoints: response and disease control rates, overall survival (OS), one year survival rates, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). RESULTS: A total of 106 patients commenced induction therapy, of whom 55 patients were randomized to maintenance pemetrexed/BSC (n = 28) or BSC (n = 27). Although the median PFS time for maintenance phase for both arms was 3.2 months, the one-sided p-value for the PFS HR comparison was less than the prespecified limit of 0.2 (HR = 0.76, two-sided 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42 to 1.37; one-sided p-value = 0.1815), indicating that PFS was sufficiently long in the pemetrexed/BSC arm to warrant further investigation. Similar PFS results were observed for the overall study period (induction plus maintenance) and when the PFS analysis was adjusted for sex, baseline disease stage, and the ECOG PS prior to randomization. The median OS for the maintenance phase was 12.2 months (95%CI: 5.6 to 20.6) for the pemetrexed/BSC arm and 11.8 months (95% CI: 6.3 to 25.6) for BSC arm. The one-year survival probabilities were similar for both arms for the maintenance phase and the overall study period. Both the induction and continuation maintenance therapies were generally well-tolerated, and similar proportion of patients in each arm experienced at least 1 grade 3/4 TEAE (pemetrexed/BSC, 17.9%; BSC, 18.5%).

Delayed referral results in the limitation of fertility preservation options because most established methods, such as embryo and oocyte  cryopreservation, require several weeks to complete. Women with BRCA mutations, on the other hand, may be more aware of fertility issues and motivated to see fertility preservation specialists earlier. Fear of exposure to estrogen limits access to fertility preservation via embryo or oocyte cryopreservation; however,  the use of aromatase inhibitors as ovarian stimulants reduces such concern. Ovarian cryopreservation can be used when there is insufficient time to perform ovarian stimulation because this technique does not require hormonal stimulation, but there are safety concerns both in women with BRCA mutations and in patients with hormone receptor-positive disease as well. There does not seem to be a proven ovarian suppression strategy to preserve fertility in women with breast cancer. Pregnancy appears to be safe for breast cancer survivors but studies specific for women with BRCA mutations are lacking. Women with BRCA mutations may elect to use preimplantation genetic diagnosis during in vitro fertilization to avoid transmitting the mutation, but there may be psychosocial difficulties in entertaining this option.

Numerous studies have documented that FoxM1 has multiple functions in tumorigenesis and its elevated levels are frequently associated with cancer progression. The present study was conducted to investigate the expression of FoxM1 and its prognostic significance in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Meanwhile, the function of FoxM1 in human ccRCC was further investigated in cell culture models. METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to explore FoxM1 expression in ccRCC cell lines and primary ccRCC clinical specimens. FoxM1 expression was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in Caki-1 and 786-O cells; proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis were assayed. RESULTS: FoxM1 expression was up-regulated in the majority of the ccRCC clinical tissue specimens at both mRNA and protein levels.  Clinic pathological analysis showed that FoxM1 expression was significantly correlated with primary tumor stage (P <0.001), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.01), distant metastasis (P = 0.01), TNM stage (P < 0.001) and histological grade (P =  0.003). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that high FoxM1 expression was  associated with poor prognosis in ccRCC patients (P < 0.001). FoxM1 expression was an independent prognostic marker of overall ccRCC patient survival in a multivariate analysis (P = 0.008). Experimentally, we found that down-regulation  of FoxM1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest with reduced  expression of cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and Cdk2, and increased expression of p21 and p27. Also, down-regulation of FoxM1 reduced expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), resulting in the inhibition of migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FoxM1 expression is likely to play important roles in ccRCC development and progression, and that FoxM1 is a prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for ccRCC.',\n",

The mechanism of CPT poisoning of TOP1 rests on inhibition of the re-ligation function of the enzyme resulting in the stabilization of the TOP1-cleavable complex. In the presence of CPTs this enzyme-DNA complex impairs transcription and DNA replication, resulting in fork stalling and the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in proliferating cells. As with most chemotherapeutics, intrinsic and acquired drug resistance represents a hurdle that limits the success of CPT therapy. Preclinical data indicate that resistance to CPT-based drugs might be caused by factors such as (a) poor drug accumulation  in the tumor, (b) high rate of drug efflux, (c) mutations in TOP1 leading to failure in CPT docking, or (d) altered signaling triggered by the drug-TOP1-DNA complex, (e) expression of DNA repair proteins, and (f) failure to activate cell  death pathways. This review will focus on the issues (d-f). We discuss degradation of TOP1 as part of the repair pathway in the processing of TOP1 associated DNA damage, give a summary of proteins involved in repair of CPT-induced replication mediated DSB, and highlight the role of p53 and inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), particularly XIAP and survivin, in cancer cell resistance to CPT-like chemotherapeutics.',\n",

CT-colonography (CTC) is one of several screening tests available. We systematically reviewed evidence on, and identified key factors influencing, cost-effectiveness of CTC screening. METHODS: PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane library were searched for cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses of CTC-based screening, published in English, January 1999  to July 2010. Data was abstracted on setting, model type and horizon, screening scenario(s), comparator(s), participants, uptake, CTC performance and cost, effectiveness, ICERs, and whether extra-colonic findings and medical complications were considered. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were identified from the  United States (n = 11), Canada (n = 2), and France, Italy, and the United Kingdom (1 each). Markov state-transition (n = 14) or microsimulation (n = 2) models were used. Eleven considered direct medical costs only; five included indirect costs.  Fourteen compared CTC with no screening; fourteen compared CTC with colonoscopy-based screening; fewer compared CTC with sigmoidoscopy (8) or fecal tests (4). Outcomes assessed were life-years gained/saved (13), QALYs (2), or both (1). Three considered extra-colonic findings; seven considered complications. CTC appeared cost-effective versus no screening and, in general, flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing. Results were mixed comparing CTC to colonoscopy. Parameters most influencing cost-effectiveness included: CTC costs, screening uptake, threshold for polyp referral, and extra-colonic findings. CONCLUSION: Evidence on cost-effectiveness of CTC screening is heterogeneous, due largely to between-study differences in comparators and parameter values. Future studies should: compare CTC with currently favored tests, especially fecal immunochemical tests; consider extra-colonic findings; and conduct comprehensive sensitivity analyses.',\n",

Although surgical advances including total mesorectal excision continue to decrease rates of local recurrence, the management of locally advanced disease (T3-T4 or N+) benefits from a multimodality approach including neoadjuvant concomitant chemotherapy and radiation. Circumferential resection margin, which can be determined preoperatively via MRI, is prognostic. Toxicity associated with radiation therapy is decreased by placing the patient in the prone position on a belly board, however for patients who cannot tolerate prone positioning, IMRT decreases the volume of normal tissue irradiated. The use of IMRT requires knowledge of the patterns of spreads and anatomy. Clinical trials demonstrate high variability in  target delineation without specific guidance demonstrating the need for peer review and the use of a consensus atlas. Concomitant with radiation, fluorouracil based chemotherapy remains the standard, and although toxicity is decreased with  continuous infusion fluorouracil, oral capecitabine is non-inferior to the continuous infusion regimen. Additional chemotherapeutic agents, including oxaliplatin, continue to be investigated, however currently should only be utilized on clinical trials as increased toxicity and no definitive benefit has been demonstrated in clinical trials. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every two years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer  reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

DESIGN: Retrospective data collection of pregnant cancer patients who delivered between January 1988 and December 2009. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical data on cancer diagnosis and treatment and obstetric, neonatal, and anesthetic management of the study patients were compiled. Analysis was done based on whether the cancer was diagnosed before or during pregnancy. MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of cancer during pregnancy at our institution was 0.1%. No difference was noted in the incidence of cancer diagnosed before and during pregnancy was noted. Women with a cancer diagnosis during pregnancy had more clinical symptoms, a higher rate of inductions (37% vs 11%; P = 0.0002) and  premature deliveries (48% vs 20%; P = 0.0003) than those with a cancer diagnosis  before delivery. No differences between groups in neonatal outcome were noted. Most patients received regional anesthesia for labor and delivery (75%); a significant number (22%) also received general anesthesia for cesarean section. Life-threatening complications were seen in those with mediastinal tumors or metastases. CONCLUSION: Women with cancer diagnosed during pregnancy are likely to require prompt therapeutic intervention and have a potential for premature delivery.

Conversely, a protective effect of prestroke statin use in the acute phase of stroke has been reported. The effect of low cholesterol on outcome in patients with and without prestroke statin treatment has not been studied. We assessed the association between low cholesterol and ischemic stroke short- and long-term outcomes and studied potential interactions with statin treatment in patients with a first-ever ischemic stroke in a prospective national registry. METHODS: Ischemic stroke patients in the National Acute Stroke Israeli (NASIS) registry with a first-ever stroke and no previous disability, dementia or cancer admitted  in all hospitals nationwide during 2-month periods in 2004, 2007 and 2010 were included (n = 1,895). Cholesterol levels </=155 mg/dl (1st quintile) were defined as low cholesterol and patients treated with statins for at least 7 days before stroke onset were categorized as prestroke statin treated. Severe stroke (NIHSS >/=11), total anterior circulation infarction, poor functional outcome (defined as discharged to a nursing facility or modified Rankin Scale >3 or death), and mortality at discharge and at 3 years were the study outcomes. Associations between low cholesterol and outcomes at discharge were assessed separately in patients with and without prestroke statin treatment using multiple logistic regression analyses. Mortality at 3 years was assessed in a subset of 681 patients with Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Patients were 67.4 +/- 13.5 years old on average; 43.1% were women. Low cholesterol was associated with  higher rates of stroke risk factors. Controlling for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, low cholesterol was significantly associated with severe stroke, total anterior circulation infarction and poor functional outcome in patients with and without statin treatment. There were no interactions between low cholesterol and prestroke statin therapy in association with outcomes. Short- and long-term mortality rates were increased for patients with low cholesterol (5.2% at discharge and 35% at 3-years) compared with higher levels (2.5% at discharge and 20.5% at 3 years). Adjusted mortality risks were increased for patients with low cholesterol; however, this finding was statistically significant only for patients not on statins before the stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Low  cholesterol is associated with increased stroke severity and poorer functional outcome in patients with and without prestroke statin use. Low-cholesterol statin-naive patients show increased risks of mortality. 'Reverse epidemiology' in the association between cholesterol and outcome is possible in patients with ischemic stroke.\",\n",

RESULTS: GDC-0941 exhibited excellent inhibition on MCF7, T-47D and SK-BR-3 cells with different characteristics. In addition, GDC-0941 blocked the feedback of PI3K/Akt through S6K1, resulting in decreased Akt activity by rapamycin activation.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Our study material consisted of: a) a pilot  testing group of 27 patients with stage I-III operable breast cancer, 46 patients with verified metastasis and 37 healthy donors and b) an independent cohort of 123 consecutive stage I-III operable breast cancer patients. Methylated and unmethylated CST6 promoter sequences were detected by using methylation-specific  PCR (MSP). CST6 immunohistochemical detection was performed in 20 corresponding primary tumor tissues. RESULTS: In the pilot testing group, CST6 promoter was methylated in 8/27 (29.6%) operable breast cancer patients, in 6/46 (13.0%) patients with verified metastasis but none of 37 healthy individuals (0%). In the independent cohort, 49/123 (39.8%) operable breast cancer patients were found positive. During the follow up period, 25/123 (20.3%) patients relapsed and 9/123 (7.3%) died.

Both drugs are observed to induce stable ion-flowing pores across membranes. Discrete pore current-time plots exhibit triangular conductance events in contrast to rectangular ones found for ion channels. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that drugs and lipids experience electrostatic and van der Waals interactions for short periods of time when found within each other's proximity. The energies from these two interactions are found to be similar to the energies derived theoretically using the screened Coulomb and the van der Waals interactions between peptides and lipids due to mainly their charge properties while forming peptide-induced ion channels in lipid bilayers. Experimental and in silico studies together suggest that the chemotherapy drugs induce ion pores inside lipid membranes due to drug-lipid physical interactions.  The findings reveal cytotoxic effects of drugs on the cell membrane, which may aid in novel drug development for treatment of cancer and other diseases.\",\n",

However, involvement of trace elements in the tumorigenesis of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder has been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between zinc, copper and bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Zinc and copper concentration and Cu/Zn ratio in two 36-sample series of bladder cancer tissue and sera from patients with this neoplasm were matched with those of the control group. The amount of trace elements in every tissue sample was determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. This was correlated with tumor stage. RESULTS: While the copper concentrations reached statistically higher values in the bladder cancer tissue, the zinc levels in the sera and bladder tissue of the patients with this carcinoma were substantially lower as compared to those of the control group. The serum Cu/Zn ratio was significantly higher in  the bladder cancer group and this increase was greater in the patients with muscle-invasive neoplasm.

Initiation of signal cascades by ErbB2 (also known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu) in breast cancer has been blocked by monoclonal antibodies such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin), which interact with the extracellular domain of  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Due to some disadvantages of monoclonal antibodies, a new approach in blocking human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 dimerization and activation is designing peptidomimetic ligands based on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-Trastuzumab interaction model. Growth of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(+) SK-BR3 cells could be specifically inhibited by peptidomimetic herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5. In this study, herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5 was used as a benchmark peptidomimetic compound  to perform a ligand-based virtual screening followed by structure-based screening by applying the molecular docking approach. The study aimed to explore more potent peptidomimetic molecules against extracellular part of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Our results showed that the newly designed peptidomimetic herceptin-based peptidomimetic n33B in comparison with herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5 binds more tightly to the extracellular domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Mechanistic aspects of herceptin-based peptidomimetic n33B interaction with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 were more investigated through 20-ns molecular dynamic simulations. Additionally, a quantitative structure-activity relationships study  was performed to develop a model for identification of structural determinants in herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5-based peptidomimetics.',\n",

This holds true for melanoma, whose incidence is increasing more rapidly than any other cancer and once disseminated has few therapeutic options. Here we performed whole exome sequencing of two sets of matched normal and metastatic tumor DNAs. RESULTS: Using stringent criteria, we evaluated the similarities and differences between the lesions. We find that in both cases, 96% of the single nucleotide variants are shared between the two metastases indicating that clonal populations gave rise to the distant metastases. Analysis of copy number variation patterns of both metastatic sets revealed a trend similar to that seen with our single nucleotide variants. Analysis of pathway enrichment on tumor sets shows commonly mutated pathways enriched between individual sets of metastases and all metastases combined.

The aims of the present study were to assess CA125 reference intervals and reference change values (RCV) in postmenopausal reference women, postmenopausal women breast cancer free, reference men and cancer free men. METHODS: The series consisted of 433 subjects: 105 postmenopausal breast cancer free women and 56 cancer free men in addition to a total of 272 reference subjects (145 postmenopausal women and 127 men). Repeated CA125 measurements were made in a subset of 149 women and 54 men to calculate RCV and index of individuality. Serum CA125 levels were evaluated by a chemiluminescent assay. RESULTS: In postmenopausal reference women, the mean CA125 value and 2.5th-97.5th percentiles were 6.70, 2.60-11.00 kU/L, respectively, with a unidirectional RCV of 38.4%. In postmenopausal breast cancer free women, the mean CA125 value and 2.5th-97.5th percentile were 7.45, 4.09-10.92 kU/L, respectively, with a RCV of 34.5%. The difference between the means was statistically significant (t=-3.02, p=0.003). In the two male subgroups, the difference between the means for CA125 was not statistically significant (t=0.43, p=0.665). On considering the entire male population, the mean CA125 value and 2.5th-97.5th percentiles were 7.50 and  2.40-13.2 kU/L, respectively, while the unidirectional RCV was 34.3%. In all the  studied groups, the indices of individuality were equal to or below 0.6.

In the past decade, active components of Rhizoma Paridis - the Paris saponins have emerged as promising anti-cancer agents. Among these saponins, polyphyllin D (Paris saponin (PS) I), has been extensively studied and proposed to be a potent antitumor agent. In this study, we continue to establish the efficacy and mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of the steroidal PS members, namely formosanin C (PSII) in ovarian cancer treatment. We isolated PSII and evaluated its effects on a panel of ten human cell lines. Isolated PSII has potent inhibitory effects on the growth of tumor cells without deleterious effects to different normal cell types or benign neoplastic derived cells. While PSII, PSI, and etoposide are effective promoting  agents for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, PSII appeared to be marginally more potent than the later two in inhibiting SKOV3 cell growth. In PSII-treated SKOV3  cells, there was an elevation in proapoptotic elements including Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, activated-caspase-3, and activated-caspase-9. The treatment also reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression. We also assessed the antitumor efficacy of intraperitoneal administration of PSII in human SKOV3 ovarian cancer xenografts in athymic mice. PSII treatment significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors relative to controls by 70% (p < 0.05). These findings demonstrated that,  in addition to the unique selectivity against cancer cells, PSII is a potent antitumor molecule that may be developed as a cancer therapeutic agent.',\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2004 and July 2011, 448 consecutive patients diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer stage IA1 L1 to IIA underwent laparoscopic staging at the Department of Gynecology and Gynecologic Oncology at  Charite Berlin. Only in patients without lymph node metastases (n = 394) on frozen section, radical operation was continued either by laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (n = 228) or by radical vaginal trachelectomy (n = 166). The decision for adjuvant RCTX was reached among the members of an interdisciplinary  tumor board according to the presence of risk factors. The mean age of patients was 39 years. Squamous cell cancer was found in 62.5%, adenocarcinoma in 32.7%, adenosquamous cancer in 3.8% and others in 1% of patients. Adjuvant treatment was indicated if at least one category 1 risk factor (pN1, R1 or RX, parametrial involvement) and/or any combination of category 2 risk factors (lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI), hemovascular space involvement, grading 3, young age, deep stromal invasion, large tumor size) were present. RESULTS: In 39 of 394 patients (9.9%), adjuvant RCTX was recommended due to category 1 risk factors (n  = 25/6.4%) and category 2 risk factors (n = 14/3.5%). Tumor-involved (R0) or unclear resection margins (RX) were present in 4 (1%) and 1 (0.3%), parametrial involvement in 12 (3%) and positive lymph nodes in 11 (2.8%) patients, respectively. Hemovascular involvement was found in 14 (3.5%), LVSI in 113 (28.7%) and grading 3 in 122 (31%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic staging is a reliable tool to keep the rate of tri-modal (surgery +  chemotherapy + radiotherapy) treatments in patients with cervical cancer stage I  and IIA after radical surgery at 10%.

Although many promising radioprotective agents are emerging, few of them have entered the market successfully due to various limitations. At present, the most accepted hypothesis for the radiation-caused injury involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), the unique enzyme responsible for the dismutation of  superoxide radicals, is expected to occupy an indispensable position in the treatment of ROS-mediated tissue injuries originating from exposure to radiation.

As there are no approved BCG-CWS formulations  for cancer therapy, we investigated the potential for cancer immunotherapy of SMP-105, our originally produced BCG-CWS. For optimizing SMP-105 emulsion, we compared the effects of drakeoland squalane-based SMP-105 emulsions on IFN-gamma  production in rats and evaluated their ability to induce skin reaction in guinea  pigs. Both emulsions had the same activity in both experiments. We selected squalane as base material and produced two types of squalane-based formulations (vialed emulsion and pumped emulsion) that can easily be prepared as oil-in-water emulsions. Although the vialed emulsion showed the same pattern of distribution as a usual homogenized emulsion, the pumped emulsion showed more uniform distribution than the other two emulsions. Whereas both emulsions enhanced strong delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction in a mouse model, the pumped emulsion induced slightly smaller edema. Data on oil droplet size distribution suggest that few micrometer oil droplet size might be appropriate for oil-in-water microemulsion of SMP-105. The antitumor potency of SMP-105 emulsion  was stronger than that of some of the launched toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists  (Aldara cream, Picibanil, and Immunobladder). Aldara and Picibanil showed limited antitumor effectiveness, while Immunobladder had almost the same effect as SMP-105 at the highest dose, but needed about 10 times the amount of SMP-105.

METHOD: Among 91 incident patients who started CAPD with either biocompatible PD  solution (Balance(R), Fresenius; LS, n = 48) or conventional PD solution (CAPD/DPCA(R), Fresenius; CS, n = 43), 63 patients, who were followed for 12 months, were enrolled and followed for an additional 12 months. RESULTS: After 24 months of treatment, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the LS group was twofold higher compared to the CS group (33.5 +/- 30.7 vs. 16.3 +/- 17.9 l/week/1.73 m(2), respectively, p = 0.021).

The increasing prevalence of obesity may be contributing to the rising incidence of this cancer over the past several decades. The effects of early-age obesity and change in body mass index (BMI) on renal cancer have been studied less thoroughly, and the influence of race has never been formally investigated. METHODS: Using data gathered as part of a large case-control study of renal cancer (1214 cases and 1234 controls), we investigated associations with BMI at several time points, as well as with height. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using logistic regression modeling. Race- and sex-stratified analyses were conducted to evaluate subgroup differences. RESULTS: Obesity (BMI >/= 30 kg/m) early in adulthood (OR = 1.6 [95% CI = 1.1 to 2.4]) and 5 years before diagnosis (1.6 [1.1 to 2.2]) was associated  with renal cancer. The association with early-adult obesity was stronger among whites than blacks (test for interaction, P = 0.006), whereas the association with obesity near diagnosis was marginally stronger in women than men (test for interaction, P = 0.08). The strongest association with renal cancer was observed  for obese whites both in early adulthood and before interview (2.6 [1.5 to 4.4]); this association was not present among blacks. Estimates of the annual excess rate of renal cancer (per 100,000 persons) attributed to both overweight and obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m) ranged from 9.9 among black men to 5.6 among white women.

This summary metric obscures variations in exposure rates among  people and within persons over time. To disentangle the effects of cumulative exposure and exposure rate, one standard approach is to simultaneously model both cumulative exposure and average exposure rate. We propose an alternative regression model that uses a person's detailed exposure history information to describe the effect of the history of exposure increments on the relative hazard  function. We illustrate this approach using data from a cohort study of radon exposure and lung cancer mortality among uranium miners. Compared with a standard cumulative exposure-average exposure rate model, our proposed approach yielded somewhat stronger evidence that the radon-lung cancer mortality association is modified by exposure rate. At low exposure rates, the estimated excess relative hazard per 100 working-level months was 0.63 (95% confidence interval = 0.32-1.37) under the standard approach, whereas under the proposed approach it was 1.23 (0.53-3.76). The proposed approach may provide better understanding of relationships between a protracted exposure and disease and is readily implemented using existing statistical software.\",\n",

All patients received treatment with gefitinib (250 mg/day), during which liver function was monitored. Of the 92 NSCLC patients, 6 (6.5%) developed mild to moderate hepatotoxicity during gefitinib treatment. The  time of onset of hepatotoxicity ranged from 7 days to 6 months after gefitinib administration. 1 patient (1.1%) suffered from grade 2 hepatotoxicity, and gradually recovered her normal liver function after reduction of the gefitinib dose. The other 5 patients with grade 1 hepatic impairment tolerated gefitinib well without requiring dose reductions or drug cessation. CONCLUSION: Gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity is not uncommon.

Previously published reviews have focused on reporting the outcomes of exercise interventions, but have not critically examined the exercise prescriptions. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the application of the principles of exercise training in the exercise prescriptions reported in intervention studies for breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Databases were searched for randomised controlled trials of exercise in women diagnosed with breast cancer. Data were extracted to evaluate the application of the principles  of exercise training, the reporting of the components of the exercise prescription and the reporting of adherence to the exercise prescription. RESULTS: Of the 29 papers included, none applied all principles of exercise training. Specificity was applied by 64%, progression by 41%, overload by 31%, initial values by 62% and diminishing returns and reversibility by 7% of trials.  No study reported all components of the exercise prescription. CONCLUSION: The application of the principles of exercise training varied greatly, and reporting  of the exercise prescribed and completed was incomplete. When principles of exercise training are applied to the development of exercise protocols, there is  greater confidence that non-significant findings reflect lack of efficacy of exercise rather than deficiencies in the prescription. Incomplete reporting of the exercise prescription and adherence to the prescription limits the reproducibility of the intervention, and the ability to determine the dose of exercise received by participants.',\n",

The activation of these receptors triggered tumor cell proliferation. Considering that invasion and metastasis is the major cause of death in cancer, we investigated the action of autoantibodies  against mAChR derived from breast cancer patients in stage I (T1N0Mx-IgG) on MCF-7 cells migration and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity. We also analyzed  the participation of phospholipase C/nitric oxide synthase/protein kinase C pathway. METHODS: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified by chromatography in protein G-agarose from blood samples of breast cancer patients obtained under informed consent. Migration was assayed by an in vitro wound assay. MMP-9 activity was quantified by zymography. RESULTS: T1N0Mx-IgG promoted tumor cell migration and increased MMP9 activity mimicking the action of the muscarinic agonist carbachol. This effect was reduced not only by the presence of atropine but also by 4-DAMP or tropicamide, antagonists for M(3) and M(4) mAChR subtypes respectively. The actions of T1N0Mx-IgG and carbachol on MCF-7 cells, involved the participation of phospholipase C/nitric oxide synthase/protein kinase C pathway. CONCLUSIONS: IgG from breast cancer patients in stage I could be promoting tumor progression by regulating migration and MMP-9 activity in tumor cells via mAChR activation. The presence of these autoantibodies could be determining the prognosis of breast cancer in these patients.',\n",

However, the administration of high-precision radiotherapy, termed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), has the potential to  significantly affect the disease course for some patients with metastatic cancer  by delivering high doses of radiation to the secondary tumours with limited high-dose delivery to adjacent healthy tissues. Indeed, such accurate delivery has been firmly established as a therapy for medically inoperable early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. To date, the technique has demonstrated improvements  in controlling metastasis and, in some cases, improved palliation compared with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Active areas of research in SBRT include patient selection for curative intent, optimization of SBRT planning techniques, dosing schema and integration of SBRT into systemic therapies. Given  the improvements in cytotoxic and targeted therapies over the past decade, studies testing the careful integration of SBRT into standard systemic therapy regimens are needed.

TRAIL inhibited HCT116 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner; however, this reduction did not occur in TRAIL resistant HT-29, A549 and HepG2 cells with an even higher dose of TRAIL. SVT, but not TRAIL enhanced expression of cell death receptor (DR) in TRAIL resistant cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. A combination of SVT with TRAIL significantly inhibited cell growth of TRAIL resistant HT-29, A549 and HepG2 cells. Consistent with cell growth inhibition, the expression of TRAIL receptors; DR4 and DR5 was significantly increased as well as apoptosis related proteins such as cleaved caspase-3, -8, -9 and Bax. However, the expression of survival proteins (e.g., cFLIP, survivin, XIAP and Bcl2) was suppressed by the combination treatment of SVT and TRAIL. Depletion of DR4 or DR5 by small interfering RNA significantly reversed the cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis blocking effects  of SVT in HCT116 and HT-29 cells. Pretreatment with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetylcysteine reduced the SVT and TRAIL-induced upregulation of DR4 and DR5 expression, expression of the apoptosis related protein such as caspase-3 and-9,  as well as cell growth inhibitory effects.

Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine significant associations with complications by a logistic regression model and the independent prognostic values by Cox's proportional hazards model.  RESULTS: Study patients (n = 1017) were allocated as follows: 904 (88.9 %) to GPS 0, 92 (9.0 %) to GPS 1, and 21 (2.1 %) to GPS 2. One hundred sixty-three patients (16.0 %) had postoperative complications of >/= grade 2. Multivariate logistic analysis identified gender, body mass index, tumor location, tumor depth, blood transfusion, and comorbidity as significantly correlated with postoperative complications.

Regarding decorin in breast malignancies the published data are conflicting, i.e., whether breast cancer cells express it or not. Here, we first compared decorin gene expression levels between healthy human breast tissue and selected types of human breast cancer using GeneSapiens databank. Next, we localized decorin mRNA in tissue specimen of normal human breast, intraductal breast papillomas and various histologic types of human breast cancer using in situ hybridization (ISH) with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes for decorin. We also examined the effect of decorin transduction on the behavior of cultured human breast cancer MCF7 cells. Analysis of GeneSapiens  databank revealed that in various human breast cancers decorin expression is significant. However, ISH results clearly demonstrated that human breast cancer cells independently of the type of the cancer do not express decorin mRNA. This was also true for papilloma-forming cells of the human breast. Indeed, decorin gene expression in healthy human breast tissue as well as in benign and malignant tumors of human breast was shown to take place solely in cells of the original stroma. Decorin transduction using decorin adenoviral vector in decorin-negative  MCF7 cells resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation of these cells and changed cell cohesion. Decorin-transduced MCF7 cells also exhibited increased apoptosis. In conclusion, our study shows that in human breast tissue only cells  of the original stroma are capable of decorin gene expression. Our study also shows that transduction of decorin in decorin-negative human breast cancer cells  markedly modulates the growth pattern of these cells.',\n",

Thus, this prospective single-center study aimed to test the feasibility of IORT  at a single dose of 21 Gy in Japanese breast cancer patients. METHODS: The primary endpoint was early toxicity; the secondary endpoint was late toxicity. Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary early breast cancer  were eligible. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) T < 2.5 cm; (2) desire for breast-conserving surgery; (3) age >50 years; (4) surgical margin >1 cm; (5) intraoperative pathologically free margins; and (6) sentinel node negative. Exclusion criteria were (1) contraindications to radiation therapy; (2) past radiation therapy for the same breast or chest; (3) extensive intraductal component; and (4) a tumor located in the axillary tail of the breast. All patients gave written informed consent. Partial resection was performed with at least a margin of 1 cm around the tumor. The patient was transported from the surgical suite to the radiation room. Radiation (Clinac((R)) 21EX, Varian Medical Systems, Inc.) at 21 Gy was delivered directly to the mammary gland. Toxicity was evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V4.0. RESULTS:  Five patients were enrolled in this pilot study and received 21 Gy. Follow-up ranged from 7.8 to 11.0 months (median 10.2). Intraoperative transportation to the radiation room during the surgical procedure under general anesthesia was performed safely in all patients. Treatment-related toxicities within 3 months were deep connective tissue fibrosis (grade 1, n = 3) and pain (grade 1, n = 3).  There was no case of wound infection, wound dehiscence, or soft tissue necrosis.  Overall, there was no severe adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure was tolerated very well in this first group of Japanese female patients treated with  IORT, as was the case with European women. A longer follow-up is needed for the evaluation of any potential late side effects or recurrences. A phase II study is now being conducted for the next group of patients (UMIN000003578).',\n",

Tetraspanins form membrane complexes with integrins. In the present study, we constructed a CD151-AAA mutant to assess the roles of Rac, cdc42 and phospho-Rac/cdc42 (P-Rac/cdc42) and the effects of CD151integrin complexes on the proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2 cells. The pAAV-CD151 and pAAVCD151AAA mutant plasmids were constructed and used  to transiently transfect HepG2 cells using the Qiagen Attractene transfection reagent. Following transfection, the expression of CD151 was determined by western blotting. A cell proliferation assay was performed using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method, cell migration was assessed by a cell wound-healing assay and cell invasion was evaluated in microchemotaxis chambers using FBS as the chemotactic stimulus. The potential involvement of various signaling pathways was explored using relevant antibodies. The association between CD151 and integrins was evaluated by immunoblotting analysis. We found that CD151 promoted cell proliferation, migration and chemotaxis and increased P-Rac/cdc42 activity. The CD151-AAA mutant had reduced cellular proliferation, migration and invasion compared with the CD151 mutant. Moreover, the CD151-AAA mutant abrogated the association between CD151 and integrins. These data suggest  that CD151 forms complexes by interacting with integrins, particularly alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1, and thereby affects the functioning of the HepG2 cells.

RESULTS: EGF activates ERK/p90RSK and Rho/Rho kinase signaling in A431 and DiFi colon cancer cells, leading to phosphorylation  of filamin A (FLNa) and inactivation of the alpha5beta1 integrin receptor. CONCLUSION: EGF promotes alpha5beta1 inactivation through the p90RSK-dependent phosphorylation of FLNa. SIGNIFICANCE: We have identified a novel EGF-dependent mechanism controlling the alpha5beta1 integrin activation state. Cell adhesion, motility, and invasion are regulated by the ligand-binding activity of integrin receptors, transmembrane proteins that bind to the extracellular matrix. Integrins whose conformation allows for ligand binding and appropriate functional activity are said to be in an active state. Integrin activation and subsequent ligand binding are dynamically regulated by the association of cytoplasmic proteins with integrin intracellular domains. In this study, we evaluated the role of EGF in the regulation of the activation state of the alpha5beta1 integrin receptor for fibronectin. The addition of EGF to either A431 squamous carcinoma cells or DiFi colon cancer cells resulted in loss of alpha5beta1-dependent adhesion to fibronectin but no loss of integrin from the cell surface. EGF activated the EGF receptor/ERK/p90RSK and Rho/Rho kinase signaling pathways. Blocking either pathway inhibited EGF-mediated loss of adhesion, suggesting that  they work in parallel to regulate integrin function. EGF treatment also resulted  in phosphorylation of filamin A (FLNa), which binds and inactivates beta1 integrins. EGF-mediated FLNa phosphorylation was completely blocked by an inhibitor of p90RSK and partially attenuated by an inhibitor of Rho kinase, suggesting that both pathways converge on FLNa to regulate integrin function. A431 clonal cell lines expressing non-phosphorylated dominant-negative FLNa were  resistant to the inhibitory effects of EGF on integrin function, whereas clonal cell lines overexpressing wild-type FLNa were more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of EGF. These data suggest that EGF-dependent inactivation of alpha5beta1  integrin is regulated through FLNa phosphorylation and cellular contractility.',\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of NO production and NOS-2 expression in HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues and to clarify whether the levels of NO/NOS-2 are related to the clinicopathological features of HCC. The levels of NO production were examined in tumor and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues of 30 patients with HCC. The expression of NOS-2 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis in  HCC and/or adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. Mutant p53 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were also immunohistochemically investigated in liver tissues. The levels of NO in HCC were significantly lower compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues (P<0.001). The relative mRNA and protein expression levels of NOS-2 in HCC were also significantly lower compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues (P<0.01 for both). We found that the levels of NO in patients suffering from HCC metastasis were lower compared to those without metastasis (P<0.05) and NOS-2 expression was correlated with tumor diameter (P<0.05) and metastasis (P<0.05). In addition, mutant p53 protein was expressed in the majority of HCC samples and the proliferation rate of HCC was significantly higher than that of adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. These data indicate that decreased levels of NO/NOS-2 may partially contribute to overexpression of the mutant p53 protein and excessive proliferation; this may be a potential mechanism in the development and progression of HCC.',\n",

NSCLC, mesothelioma and prostate cancer cell lines were treated with decitabine and gemcitabine. Reactivation of epigenetically silenced genes was examined by RT-PCR/qPCR. DNA methyltransferase activity in nuclear extracts and recombinant proteins was measured using a DNA methyl-transferase assay, and alterations in DNA methylation status were examined using methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and pyrosequencing. We observe a reactivation of several epigenetically silenced genes including GSTP1, IGFBP3 and RASSF1A. Gemcitabine functionally inhibited DNA methyltransferase activity in both nuclear extracts and recombinant proteins. Gemcitabine dramatically destabilised DNMT1 protein. However, DNA CpG methylation was for the most part unaffected by gemcitabine. In  conclusion, gemcitabine both inhibits and destabilises DNA methyltransferases and reactivates epigenetically silenced genes having activity equivalent to decitabine at concentrations significantly lower than those achieved in the treatment of patients with solid tumours.

They are also the best similitude for a human body for etiological and pathological research of diseases. All pharmaceutically developed drugs must be proven to be safe and effective in animals before approval by the Food and Drug Administration to be used in clinical trials. To this end, the transgenic animal models of diseases serve as the front line of drug evaluation.  However, there is currently no transgenic animal model for microRNA (miRNA) research. miRNAs, small single-stranded regulatory RNAs capable of silencing intracellular gene transcripts (mRNAs) that contain either complete or partial complementarity to the miRNA, are useful for the design of new therapies against  cancer polymorphism and viral mutation. Recently, varieties of natural miRNAs have been found to derived from hairpin-like RNA precursors in almost all eukaryotes, including yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), plant (Arabidopsis spp.), nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), fly (Drosophila melanogaster), fish, mouse, and human, involving intracellular defense against viral infections and regulation of certain gene expressions during development. To facilitate the miRNA research in vivo, we have developed a state-of-the-art transgenic strategy  for silencing specific genes in zebrafish, chicken, and mouse, using intronic miRNAs. By insertion of a hairpin-like pre-miRNA structure into the intron region of a gene, we have found that mature miRNAs were successfully transcribed by RNA  polymerases type II (Pol II), coexpressed with the encoding gene transcript, and  excised out of the encoding gene transcript by natural RNA splicing and processing mechanisms. In conjunction with retroviral transfection systems, the designed hairpin-like pre-miRNA construct was further tested to insert into the intron regions of a cellular gene for tissue-specific expression regulated by the gene promoter. Because the retroviral vectors were randomly integrated into the genome of its host cell, the most effective transgenic animal can be selected and propagated to be a stable transgenic line for future research. Here, we have shown for the first time that transgene-like animal models were generated using the intronic miRNA-expressing system described previously, which has been proven  to be useful for both miRNA research and in vivo evaluation of miRNA-associated target gene functions.',\n",

MicroRNAs (miRNA)  are short nucleotide sequences (between 19 and 25 nucleotides long) that bind to  various targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences post-transcriptionally through complementary binding and control gene expression, often through silencing or leading to the degradation of targeted mRNA. Studies have shown that miRNAs are expressed abnormally in various cancers, suggesting that they play a pivotal role in cancer development and progression. Some miRNAs are oncogenes that incite cancerous growth, while others are involved in tumor suppression and cell cycle controls. MiRNA expression also differs in various types of cancers. Studies of PC-specific miRNAs show potential for their utilization in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PC to more effectively target tumor growth and provide patients with better therapeutic options.\",\n",

To address this disease-spe-cific dilemma we aimed to establish animal models, which can be used for identifying new specific tumor markers, as well as serving as tools for potential therapeutic approaches. From a panel of sixteen pancreatic cancer cell lines, two human (Suit2-007 and Suit2-013) and a rat (ASML) cell line were selected for their properties to grow in the liver of male RNU rats and mimic liver metastasis of PDAC. For better monitoring of metastatic tumor growth in vivo, all three pancreatic cancer cell lines were stably transfected with eGFP and luciferase marker genes. In addition, the mRNA expression profile of 13 human PDAC cell lines was analyzed by BeadChip array analysis. Only 33 genes and 5 signaling pathways were identified as significantly associated with the ability of the cell lines to grow initially and/or consistently in rat liver. Only a minority of these genes (osteopontin, matrix metalloproteinase-1 and insulin-like growth factor 1) has been intensively studied and shown to be closely related to cancer  progression. The function of the remaining 30 genes ranges from moderate to poorly investigated, and their function in cancer progression is still unclear.

The overall success rate of new drug development in anthracycline/taxane patients was only 15 %, while in HER2-positive patients it was 23 %. However, HER2-targeted therapies  underperformed compared to broad acting agents. The cost for clinical trial testing alone, when adjusted for the risk of failure, for HER2-positive breast cancer patients was $199 million, significantly lower than the cost of $274 million for anthracycline/taxane-experienced patients. The use of a validated biomarker, such as HER2, reduced clinical trial risk by as much as 50 % resulting in cost savings of 27 % in advanced and metastatic breast cancer.

Dysregulation of c-Met function, through mutational activation or overexpression, has been observed in many types of cancer and is thought to contribute to tumor growth and metastasis by affecting mitogenesis, invasion, and angiogenesis. We identified human monoclonal antibodies that bind to the extracellular domain of c-Met and inhibit tumor growth by interfering with ligand-dependent c-Met activation. We identified antibodies representing four independent epitope classes that inhibited both ligand binding and ligand-dependent activation of c-Met in A549 cells. In cells, the antibodies antagonized c-Met function by blocking receptor activation and by subsequently inducing downregulation of the receptor, translating to phenotypic effects in soft agar growth and tubular morphogenesis assays. Further characterization of the antibodies in vivo revealed significant inhibition of c-Met activity (>/= 80% lasting for 72-96 h) in excised tumors corresponded to tumor growth inhibition in multiple xenograft tumor models. Several of the antibodies identified inhibited the growth of tumors engineered to overexpress human HGF and human c-Met (S114 NIH 3T3) when grown subcutaneously in athymic mice. Furthermore, lead candidate antibody CE-355621 inhibited the growth of U87MG human glioblastoma and GTL-16 gastric xenografts by up to 98%.

A number of studies have shown that extracellular signal-activated kinases can target chromatin-modifying complexes directly and regulate their function. The molecular connection between the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and chromatin has been described, by showing that NO signaling regulates histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and influences gene expression in different cell types. In present study, we investigated HDACs changes in HeLa cells undergoing growth inhibition and apoptosis, caused by HDACI BML-210 and retinoic acid (ATRA). Cell cycle analysis indicated that HeLa cell treatment with 20 and 30 muM concentration of BML-210 increased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase, and caused accumulation in subG1, indicating that the cells are undergoing apoptosis. We determined down-regulation of HDAC 1-5 and 7 after treatment with BML-210. Also, we demonstrated expression of different isoforms of alpha-dystrobrevin (alpha-DB) and other components of DAPC such as syntrophin, dystrophin, beta-dystrobrevin (beta-DB) and NOS in HeLa cells after treatments. We determined changes in protein expression level of dystrophin, NOS1, alpha- and beta-DB and in subcellular localization of alpha-DB after treatments with BML-210 and ATRA. In conclusion, these results suggest that HDACI BML-210 can inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in cervical cancer cells, what correlates with down-regulation of HDAC class I and II and changes in the DAPC expression levels. This can be important for identifying target proteins in DAPC signaling to HDACs, as a target of pharmacological intervention for treatment of muscular dystrophies and other diseases.',\n",

METHODS: Eligible participants were 20 to 39 years of age. There were N = 979 who self-reported a cancer diagnosis between the ages of 15 to 34 years and were at least 5 years from diagnosis (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer). The remaining 67,216 participants with no cancer history were used as controls. Using multivariable regressions, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were generated to examine the relationship of survivor status on indicators of poor health care (uninsured, no personal health care provider, no routine care, and avoiding seeing a doctor due to cost). Adjusted proportions were calculated by demographic groups. Results are weighted by Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey design. RESULTS: Although the proportion uninsured did not differ (21% of survivors vs 23% of controls), AYA survivors reported forgoing care due to cost at higher levels than controls (relative risk = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.44-1.94). Cost barriers were particularly high for survivors aged 20 to 29 years (44% vs 16% of  controls; P < .001) and female survivors (35% vs 18% of controls; P < .001). Survivors reporting poorer health had more cost barriers. Moreover, uninsured survivors tended to report lower use of health care than did controls. CONCLUSIONS: AYA cancer survivors may forgo health care due to cost barriers, potentially inhibiting the early detection of late effects. Expanding health insurance coverage for young cancer survivors may be insufficient without adequate strategies to reduce their medical cost burdens.',\n",

Survival signaling and apoptosis resistance are hallmarks of malignant glioma cells. However, recent studies have  shown that other types of cell death such as autophagy can be induced in malignant glioma cells. This suggests that stimulation of this process may be explored in new therapeutic strategies against glioblastoma multiforme. Protein kinase CK2 is a highly conserved and constitutively active enzyme that promotes numerous cellular processes such as survival, proliferation and differentiation.  CK2 has been found elevated in several malignancies including brain tumors, and to confer resistance against chemotherapeutic agents and apoptotic stimuli. Recently, we have shown that the siRNA-mediated downregulation of CK2 leads to cell death in DNA-PK-proficient human glioblastoma cells. We show, here, that lack of CK2 results in significant induction of autophagic cell death in two human glioblastoma cell lines, M059K and T98G, as indicated by the positive staining of cells with the acidotropic dye acridine orange, and the specific recruitment of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) to autophagosome membranes. Induction of autophagy is accompanied by CK2-dependent decreased phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal S6 and AKT kinases and significantly reduced expression levels of Raptor. In contrast, phosphorylation and activity levels of ERK1/2 are enhanced suggesting an inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 and activation of the ERK1/2 pathways. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated silencing of CK2 results in increased mitochondrial superoxide production in both glioblastoma cell lines. However, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species release correlates with induction of autophagy only in T98G cells. Taken together, our findings identify CK2 as a novel component of the autophagic machinery and underline the potential of its downregulation to kill glioblastoma cells by overcoming the resistance to multiple anticancer agents.',\n",

However, some important membrane-resident tumor-associated peptides, such as the HER-2/neu (c-erbB2) oncogenic protein, cannot be purified from HSP70 by traditional methods. In the present study, a new approach for the purification of HSP70-PCs from HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells was established. The detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) was used to obtain more effectual tumor peptides. The new purified product was named HSP70-HER-2-PC, and its immunological activities were determined. Traditionally purified HSP70-PCs (without CHAPS) and recombinant human HSP70-HER-2 protein complexes (recombined in vitro) were used as controls. These three HSP70-associated tumor antigenic complex pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) were used to stimulate an antitumor response. The mature DCs pulsed with HSP70-HER-2-PCs stimulated autologous T cells to secrete higher levels of type I cytokine compared to the two control groups. Moreover, DCs pulsed with HSP70-HER-2-PCs induced the most specific CD8+ T cells that specifically killed the same tumor cells.

One attractive biological function of Che-1 is promoting the transcription of p53 after DNA damage; besides, it can also regulate cell cycle via interacting with retinoblastoma protein. Although previous evidence has showed its anti-apoptotic role in cancer cells, some studies point out that Che-1 might play an opposite role in central nervous system (CNS). However, the function of Che-1 in CNS is still with limited acquaintance. To investigate whether Che-1 is involved in CNS lesion, we performed a traumatic brain injury model in adult rats. Up-regulation of Che-1 was observed in the peritrauma brain cortex by performing western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxy-UTP nick-end labeling and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining suggested that Che-1 was involved in neuronal apoptosis after brain injury. We also investigated co-localization of Che-1 and active-caspase-3 in the ipsilateral brain cortex. In addition, the expression patterns of p53, Bax and PCNA were parallel with that of Che-1. Besides this, neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homolog was found to  be associated with Che-1 after brain trauma. Based on our data, we suggested that Che-1 might play an important role in neuronal apoptosis following TBI; and might provide a basis for the further study on its role in regulating the expression of p53 and cell cycle re-entry in traumatic brain injury.\",\n",

METHODS: We enrolled 588 patients who had undergone curative resection for gastric cancer. Input variables for risk assessment consisted of 3  categories: patient demographics, surgical and pathological factors, and anemia-related factors. Postoperative outcomes included 30-day morbidity and mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors influencing postoperative complications. RESULTS: The rate of total complications was 19.0%. Comorbidity, lowest hemoglobin (Hb) level from the operative day up to postoperative day 7 (LOW-Hb), the percentage of drop in Hb level on postoperative day 2 (POD2-Hb change), and postoperative transfusion were independent risk factors in the multivariate analysis, with LOW-Hb and postoperative transfusion found to be the most significant factors. When LOW-Hb was >/=9.0 g/dL, postoperative complications were higher in the transfused group  than in the non-transfused group (60.0 vs. 14.2%, respectively, p = 0.024), but when LOW-Hb was <9.0 g/dL, postoperative complications were not different between the 2 groups (44.6 vs. 37.5%, p = 0.525).

Genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation seem to have additional functions in post-mitotic neurons involved in neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a dominant role in the regulation of gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS). Due to their involvement in  a large number of CNS pathways, miRNAs pose as appealing molecules for further investigation, with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value. In the present study, we investigated the potential association between cancer and schizophrenia in 2 patient sample groups. We analyzed a large number of miRNAs in a control group of 6 schizophrenic patients and a study group of 8 schizophrenic  patients with a solid tumor. A comparison between the control and study groups showed that only miR-183 was differentially expressed. Specifically, a significant downregulation of miR-183 in the samples of the study group was observed. Although a larger sample size is required to validate this result for the general patient population, our findings provide a first indication that miR-183 may play a role in regulating the expression of other genes with onco-suppressor activity. Our results are in agreement with the theory that patients with schizophrenia may have a tumor suppressor gene or enhanced neuronal apoptotic activities.

The objective of this study was to assess the combined chemopreventive effect of solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) encapsulated drugs aspirin (ASP), curcumin (CUR) and free sulforaphane (SFN) for the chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer. Experiments were carried out (1) to evaluate the feasibility of encapsulation of  these chemopreventive agents within solid lipid systems and (2) to measure the synergistic effects of a combination of ASP with CUR in SLNs mixed with free SFN  against cell proliferation and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1. The SLNs were prepared using a modified solvent evaporation technique and were characterized for particle sizing, encapsulation efficiency and drug release. ASP and CUR SLNs were formulated within the particle size range of 150250 nm and were found to have an encapsulation efficiency of 85 and 69%, respectively. Sustained release of drugs over a 96 h period from SLNs was observed. The SLNs were stable over a 3-month storage period at room temperature. Cell viability studies demonstrated that combinations of low doses of ASP SLN (25 microM), CUR SLN (2.5 microM) and free SFN (5 microM) significantly reduced cell  viability by 43.6 and 48.49% in MIAPaca-2 and Panc-1 cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, increased apoptosis of 61.3 and 60.37% was found in MIA Paca-2 and Panc-1 cell lines, respectively, in comparison to the individual doses administered. Synergistic effects were demonstrated using MTS and apoptosis assays. Thus, this study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a solid lipid nanoparticulate system for the first time to deliver this novel combination chemoprevention regimen, providing valuable evidence for the usability of nanotechnology-based drug regimens towards pancreatic cancer chemoprevention.',\n",

We investigated whether HNC and its comorbidity also  influence routine laboratory values and whether these values have influence on overall survival. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 261 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx diagnosed between  2001 and 2006 with a complete set of pretherapeutic laboratory values was identified. The influence of standard oncological parameters, comorbidity, and each laboratory value on overall survival (OS) was investigated in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Two-thirds of patients were active smokers and about one half reported high alcohol consumption. 40 % of patients had severe comorbidity according to Charlson comorbidity index. The most frequent laboratory pathologies were elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) values (66 %), impaired liver  enzymes (30-50 %), decreased urea levels (33 %), leukocytosis (20 %), and anemia  (10 %). In multivariate analysis for OS, a comorbidity index >/=5 (Hazard ratio [HR], 2.008; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.117-3.610; p = 0.020), high CRP level (HR, 2.469; CI, 1.414-4.310; p = 0.001), and abnormal low red-cell count (HR, 2.525; CI, 1.250-5.102; p = 0.010) were independent prognostic variables.

An enriched set of 33 genes differentially expressed in common between primary PDAC and liver metastases, when compared to normal tissues, was obtained through global gene expression profiling. This metastasis-associated gene set comprises transcripts from both cancer (S100P, S100A6, AGR2, etc.) and adjacent stroma (collagens type I, III, and V, etc.), thus reinforcing the concept of a continuous crosstalk between the two compartments in both primary tumours and their metastases. The expression of S100P, SFN, VCAN and collagens was further validated in additional primary PDACs  and matched liver metastatic lesions, while the functional significance of one of the most highly expressed genes, S100P, was studied in more detail. We show that  this protein increases the transendothelial migration of PDAC cancer cells in vitro, which was also confirmed in vivo experiments using a zebrafish embryo model. Thus S100P facilitates cancer cell intravasation/extravasation, critical steps in the hematogenous dissemination of pancreatic cancer cells.',\n",

Three different miRNA target gene databases (miRanda, TargetScan and PicTar) were used for searching the potential genes regulated by miRNAs.

Since pancreatic tumors frequently overexpress these proteins, we investigated its effects, both alone and in conjunction with 5-FU or GEM. The pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and AsPC were treated with varying doses of lapatinib in vitro. The effects on ErbB1/ErbB2 protein phosphorylation and on the cell survival protein survivin were determined by western blotting. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay and apoptosis was measured using the caspase-3 colorimetric assay. Similar dose-response lapatinib experiments were conducted with varying concentrations of 5-FU or GEM and isobolograms were constructed to evaluate therapeutic synergy. Lapatinib inhibited protein phosphorylation in the range of 4-16 microM, a clinically achievable concentration. The lapatinib-treated cells showed a dose-dependent inhibition of  cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis at the same concentrations that blocked ErbB1/ErbB2 phosphorylation. The addition of 5-FU or GEM to these cells resulted in synergistic effects. The lapatinib-treated cells also demonstrated downregulation of survivin. Simultaneous dual ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition with lapatinib results in significant reduction of pancreatic cancer cell growth and proliferation.

In the past 2 decades, sentinel lymph node biopsy has become popular as a way to minimize the morbidity associated with axillary dissection without compromising the cure rate for breast cancer patients. However, even with sentinel node biopsy, the postoperative incidence of upper limb lymphedema in breast cancer patients remains at 4-10%. Lymphedema occasionally emerges immediately after surgery but most often appears after a latent period. Obesity,  postoperative seroma, and radiation therapy have been reported as major risk factors for upper extremity lymphedema, but the etiology of lymphedema is still not fully understood. Common symptoms of upper limb lymphedema are increased volume and weight of the affected limb and increased skin tension. The increased  volume of the affected limb not only causes physical impairments in wearing clothes and in dexterity but also affects patients' emotional and mental status.  Surgical management of lymphedema can be broadly categorized into physiologic methods and reductive techniques. Physiologic methods such as flap interposition, lymph node transfers, and lymphatic bypass procedures aim to decrease lymphedema  by restoring lymphatic drainage. In contrast, reductive techniques such as direct excision or liposuction aim to remove fibrofatty tissue generated as a consequence of sustained lymphatic fluid stasis. Currently, microsurgical variations of lymphatic bypass, in which excess lymph trapped within the lymphedematous limb is redirected into other lymphatic basins or into the venous  circulation, have gained popularity.\",\n",

AIMS: Elucidate predictors of complications and mortality with long-term follow-up in cancer patients undergoing PEG. METHOD: Retrospective review of all patients undergoing PEG placement at MD Anderson Cancer Center from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 218 subjects underwent PEG. Those with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scores of 4, 4E, or 5E were at significant risk of a major complication in the first 30 days.  Multivariate analysis revealed ASA scores >/=4, elevated WBC count, and advanced  tumor stage to be independent predictors of mortality in the first 30 days and INR >1.5 and diversion/venting as an indication for PEG placement to be independent predictors of overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high baseline illness severity are more likely to have complications and are at increased risk of mortality after PEG. Our study results suggest that particular  attention be directed to ASA score, INR, WBC counts, transfusion requirements, presence of advanced malignancies, and the indication for PEG placement when determining risk of complications or death.

Recent studies revealed that there is a relationship between CRC occurrence and microRNA (miRNA) function. Stem cells are a type of cells that have the ability to self-renew and to proliferate extensively while maintaining the undifferentiated state. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are closely linked to tumor  recurrence and metastasis. To this end, we evaluated the miRNA expression differences between colon CSCs and non-stem cells using the SW1116 cell line, to  determine the relationship between tumor stem cells and tumor biological behavior. We isolated populations of colon CSCs with the CD133+/CD44+ and CD133-/CD44- surface phenotype from a human SW1116 colon adenocarcinoma cell line using flow cytometry. The expression of miRNA and mRNA of both sets of cells was  examined with miRNA and mRNA arrays. Bioinformatic methods were used to analyze microarray results. We completed gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis, miRNA  target gene prediction with databases. We identified a colon stem cell miRNA expression profile comprising 31 upregulated and 31 downregulated miRNAs, such as miR29a, miR29b, miR449b and miR4524. Some of these differentially expressed miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation. Gene ontology and pathway analyses showed that the differences are closely related to  the function of the cell cycle, cell differentiation, signaling pathway, cytoskeletal proteins and cell-matrix adhesion in colon cancer stem cells. We found that miRNAs play an important role in regulating the expression of colon CSC characteristics. By regulating the expression of CSC signaling pathways, cytoskeleton and membrane proteins, miRNAs give tumor stem cells the macrobiological behavior of recurrence and metastasis. This study provides a new  perspective on CRC metastasis and recurrence.',\n",

Therefore, we aimed to characterize the biological relevance of PTPRJ for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In pVHL-negative ccRCC cell lines, both  RNA and protein expression levels of PTPRJ were lower than those in the corresponding pVHL reconstituted cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis of ccRCC with known VHL mutation status and normal matched tissues as well as RNA in situ hybridization on a tissue microarray (TMA) confirmed a decrease of PTPRJ expression in more than 80% of ccRCCs, but in only 12% of papillary RCCs. ccRCC patients with no or reduced PTPRJ mRNA expression had a less favourable outcome than those with a normal expression status (p = 0.05). Sequence analysis of 32 PTPRJ mRNA-negative ccRCC samples showed five known polymorphisms but no mutations, implying other mechanisms leading to PTPRJ's down-regulation. Selective silencing of HIF-alpha by siRNA and reporter gene assays demonstrated that pVHL inactivation reduces PTPRJ expression through a HIF-dependent mechanism, which is mainly driven by HIF-2alpha stabilization. Our  results suggest PTPRJ as a member of a pVHL-controlled pathway whose suppression  by HIF is critical for ccRCC development.\",\n",

The current study used this imaging platform to test the hypothesis that a more reducing tumor microenvironment accompanies the development of tumor hypoxia. To  test this, the redox status of the tumor was measured using Tempol as a redoxsensitive MRI contrast agent, and tumor hypoxia was measured with Oxo63, which is an oxygen-sensitive EPRI spin probe. Images were acquired every 1-2 days in mice bearing SCCVII tumors. The median pO(2) decreased from 14 mmHg at 7 days  after tumor implantation to 7 mmHg at 15 days after implantation. Additionally, the hypoxic fraction, defined as the percentage of the tumor that exhibited a pO(2)<10 mmHg, increased with tumor size (from 10% at 500 mm(3) to 60% at 3,500 mm(3)). The rate of Tempol reduction increased as a function of tumor volume (0.4 min(-1) at 500 mm(3) to 1.7 min(-1) at 3,500 mm(3)), suggesting that the tumor microenvironment became more reduced as the tumor grew.

As the cancer stem cell (CSC) theory became widely studied, new methods were developed to culture and expand cancer cells with conserved determinants of \"stemness\". These cells show increased ability to grow in suspension as spheres in serum-free medium supplemented with growth factors and chemicals. The physiological relevance of this phenomenon in established cancer cell lines remains unclear. Cell lines have traditionally been used to explore tumor biology and serve as preclinical models for the screening of potential therapeutic agents. Here, we grew cell-forming spheres (CFS) from 25 established colorectal cancer cell lines. The molecular and cellular characteristics of CFS were compared to the bulk of tumor cells. CFS could be isolated from 72 % of the cell lines. Both CFS and their parental CRC cell lines were highly tumorigenic. Compared to their parental cells, they showed similar expression of putative CSC markers. The ability of CRC cells to grow as CFS was greatly enhanced by prior treatment with 5-fluorouracil. At the molecular level, CFS and parental CRC cells showed identical gene mutations and very similar genomic profiles, although microarray analysis revealed changes in CFS gene expression that were independent of DNA copy-number. We identified a CFS gene expression signature common to CFS from all CRC cell lines, which was predictive of disease relapse in CRC patients. In conclusion, CFS models derived from CRC cell lines possess interesting phenotypic features that may have clinical relevance for drug resistance and disease relapse.',\n",

Preclinical studies suggest that the overexpression of biglycan (proteoglycan-I, PG-I), a leucine-rich protein of the  ECM, may induce growth arrest of pancreatic cancer cells. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic role of biglycan expression in pancreatic cancer. We also evaluated MIB-1 and COX-2 expressions (as potential markers of growth and aggressiveness) to better characterize the biology of the tumors. The classical pathological parameters (grading, desmoplasia, perineural, or vascular invasion)  as well as molecular determinants of prognosis were examined. MIB-1 (a proliferative index associated with prognosis in most tumors), COX-2, and PG-I expressions were detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence on tissue samples from 53 patients with pancreatic cancer and reviewed by two independent pathologists. To verify PG-I expression, three rabbit sera (LF104, LF112, and LF121 from NIH, Bethesda, MA, US) were tested. Logrank test and Cox's  model were applied for statistical analysis. Out of 53 patients, 40 had stage III and IV pancreatic cancer. Fourteen patients did not express any of the PG-I epitopes. The patients who expressed at least two PG-I epitopes had shorter survival compared to those with single epitope or lacking any expression (28 vs 44 weeks, P = 0.0021). The MIB-1 higher expression predicted shorter survival (25 vs 41 weeks, P = 0.0059). The other parameters were not associated with clinical  outcome. Multivariate analyses confirmed PG-I expression and MIB-1 as independent negative prognostic factors. Patients who presented PG-I expression in the ECM had the worse prognosis compared to those who did not. Our results are not in contrast with the hypothesis that ECM proteins are a potential barrier to metastatic spread in localized pancreatic cancer.

How this population participates in cervical remodelling and neoplasia is unclear. In the present study, we analysed the SC junction immunophenotype during pre- and post-natal human and mouse development and in the adult, processes of metaplastic evolution of the SC junction, microglandular change, and early cervical neoplasia. Early in life, embryonic cervical epithelial cells were seen throughout the cervix and subsequently diminished in number to become concentrated at the SC junction in the adult. In all settings, there was a repetitive scenario in which cuboidal embryonic/SC junction cells gave rise to subjacent metaplastic basal/reserve cells with a switch from the SC junction positive to negative immunophenotype. This downward or basal (rather than upward or apical) evolution from progenitor cell to metaplastic progeny was termed reverse or 'top down' differentiation. A similar pattern was noted in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), suggesting that HPV infection of the cuboidal SC junction cells initiated outgrowth of basally-oriented neoplastic progeny. The progressive loss of the embryonic/SC junction markers occurred with 'top down' differentiation during development, remodelling, and early neoplasia. Interestingly, most low-grade SILs were SC junction-negative, implying infection of metaplastic progeny rather than  the original SC junction cells. This proposed model of 'top down' differentiation resolves the mystery of how SC junction cells both remodel the cervix and participate in neoplasia and provides for a second population of metaplastic progeny (including basal and reserve cells), the infection of which is paradoxically less likely to produce a biologically aggressive precursor. It also provides new targets in animal models to determine why the SC junction is uniquely susceptible to carcinogenic HPV infection.\",\n",

RESULTS: Fifty-five survivors and forty-three parents of survivors completed the  questionnaire. Median age of respondents was 41 years (range, 17-58). Respondents rated the website's usability with a mean SUS score of 72.5 (95 % CI, 69.2-74.9). The mean content rating was 3.7 (95 % CI, 3.5-3.8). No determinants were significantly related to the perceived usability or content satisfaction in multivariate analyses. Qualitative analysis revealed respondents' preference for  more detailed and even scientific information on late effects. CONCLUSION: Respondents were satisfied with the usability and the contents of a website that  targeted at their information needs. As knowledge about late effects is still limited among survivors, a website can be a valuable resource to improve their knowledge, promote healthy behavior, and in the end, improve their quality of life.\",\n",

METHODS: We analyzed 340 DCIS patients who were diagnosed by needle biopsies. Final pathology and clinicopathological features were reviewed. Predictors were accessed using the Chi-square test and a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The overall DCIS underestimation rate was 42.6%. The underestimation was significantly related to  the palpability, mass or calcification by ultrasonography, grade, suspicious microinvasion, and biopsy method in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, palpability, ultrasonographic calcification or mass, suspicious microinvasion, and core needle biopsy were independent predictors of underestimation of invasive cancer. In cases with one or no risk predictors, the  underestimation rate was 14.3%, whereas, in those with five predictors, it increased to 90.9%. Among 144 invasive cancer patients who underwent axillary staging, 15.4% had node metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: DCIS diagnosed by preoperative needle biopsy has a high probability of underestimation, and 15% of invasive cancer patients have node metastasis. SLNB may be justified in DCIS patients undergoing needle biopsies, and caution should be exercised in omitting SLNB in patients with one or no risk predictors.',\n",

Their activity is regulated, in part, by cell surface NK cell receptors. NK receptors can be divided into two unrelated, but functionally analogous superfamilies based on the structure of their extracellular ligand-binding domains. Receptors belonging to the C-type lectin superfamily are predominantly encoded in the natural killer complex (NKC), while receptors belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily are predominantly encoded in the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). Natural killer cell receptors are emerging as a rapidly evolving gene family which can display significant intra- and interspecific variation. To date, most studies have focused on eutherian mammals, with significantly less known about the evolution of these receptors in marsupials. Here, we describe the identification of 43 immunoglobulin domain-containing LRC genes in the genome of the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), the largest remaining marsupial carnivore and only the second marsupial species to be studied. We also identify orthologs of NKC genes KLRK1, CD69, CLEC4E, CLEC1B, CLEC1A and an ortholog of an opossum NKC receptor. Characterisation of these regions in a second, distantly related marsupial provides new insights into the dynamic evolutionary histories of these receptors  in mammals. Understanding the functional role of these genes is also important for the development of therapeutic agents against Devil Facial Tumour Disease, a  contagious cancer that threatens the Tasmanian devil with extinction.',\n",

However, some biologically active natural products are well known to provoke unexpected cellular responses. They reduce overexpression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in cancer cells. The aim of the current study was to determine whether methanolic extract of V. album, which possesses antioxidant activity, has an effect on expression levels of Hsp27 and 14-3-3 proteins in a C6 glioma cell line. For the  first time, the apoptosis-inducing effect of this extract was also determined via caspase-3 activation in the cells. Overexpression of Hsps was induced by heat shock at 42 degrees C for 1 h. Expression levels of Hsp27 and 14-3-3 proteins were determined using Western blot analysis. The apoptosis-inducing effect was also evaluated via caspase-3 activation in C6 glioma cells. Pretreatment of the cells with a nontoxic dose (100 mug/mL) of V. album extract before heat shock significantly reduced expression levels of Hsp27 (73%) and 14-3-3beta (124%), 14-3-3gamma (23%), and 14-3-3zeta (84%) proteins. Pretreatment with the extract before heat shock increased apoptosis via caspase-3 activation (60%) in C6 glioma cells. This result suggested that the methanolic extract of V. album downregulates expression of Hsp27 and 14-3-3 chaperone proteins and induces apoptosis, which warrants further exploration as a potential bioactive compound for cancer therapy.',\n",

However, no available information showed antitumor effects in human breast adenocarcinoma cells. The current study was focused on exploring the mechanisms underlying AITC-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells in vitro. We found that AITC reduced the cell number and viability using trypan blue staining with the Countess Automated Cell Counter and the MTT assay, respectively. AITC also was found to induce apoptotic cell morphological changes by a contrast-phase microscope and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase by flow cytometric assay in MDA-MB-468 cells. Intrinsic apoptosis-associated factors such as caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities were performed, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Psim) occurred in AITC-treated MDA-MB-468 cells. AITC also stimulated mitochondria-related signaling, including p-Bcl-2 (Ser-70), cytochrome c and Apaf-1 in MDA-MB-468 cells. We found that the p-ERK signal was upregulated in AITC-treated cells. Importantly, NAC (a ROS scavenger) and U0126 (an ERK inhibitor) abolished AITC-reduced viability in MDA-MB-468 cells. AITC downregulated CDK1 activity and  altered the expression of G(2)/M phase-modulated associated protein levels by western blotting in MDA-MB-468 cells. In summary, our findings demonstrated that  AITC-promoted G2/M phase and AITC-triggered apoptosis correlate with the activation of phosphorylation of ERK in MDA-MB-468 cells.

It is frequently deregulated by mutations and overexpression in different cancer types including solid tumors such as breast cancer. Another common feature of solid tumors is hypoxia, which occurs due to defective or insufficient vascularization. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are key regulators of the homeostatic response to low oxygen levels. HIF-1alpha is overexpressed in many solid tumors, including breast cancer. Hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF transcription factors has been shown to lead to NOTCH activation in vitro in different contexts and tissues, causing differentiation arrest and induction of proliferation and migration. METHODS: Since the link between HIF-1alpha and NOTCH signalling has hardly been studied, we set out to closely investigate associations between the expression of HIF-1alpha and NOTCH pathway members in primary and metastatic human breast cancer specimens and their prognostic value. RESULTS: Co-expression of NOTCH1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and HIF-1alpha was associated with a high grade and  a high proliferation rate in invasive breast cancer. HIF-1alpha expression was low in classic, but high in pleomorphic lobular cancers, which also frequently showed stromal HIF-1alpha expression. NOTCH1 pathway activation was prognostically unfavorable. CONCLUSION: In breast cancer, NOTCH pathway activation appears to be associated with a poor prognosis, but NOTCH and HIF signaling do not seem to be functionally associated.',\n",

STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study with matched-pair analysis of patients irradiated for HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharygeal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients treated by IMRT to 70 Gy for locally advanced, HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx were matched to one HPV-negative control subject by age, gender, performance status, T-category, tumor location, and the use of concurrent chemotherapy. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated on daily IGRT scans obtained via kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Mathematical modeling using fitted mixed-effects repeated measure analysis was performed to quantitatively and descriptively assess the trajectory of tumor regression. RESULTS: Patients with HPV-positive tumors experienced a more rapid rate of tumor regression between day 1 of IMRT and the beginning of week 2 (-33% Delta GTV) compared to their counterparts with HPV-negative tumors (-10% Delta GTV), which was statistically significant (p<0.001). During this initial period, the average absolute change in GTV was -22.9 cc/week for HPV-positive tumors and -5.9 cc/week for HPV-negative tumors (p<0.001). After week 2 of IMRT, the rates of GTV regression were comparable between the two groups.

Molecular events at short length scales lead to an initial tumorigenic population, which left unchecked by immune action, acts at increasingly longer length scales until eventually the cancer cells escape from the primary tumor site. This series of events is highly complex, involving multiple cell types interacting with (and shaping) the microenvironment. Multiscale mathematical models have emerged as a powerful tool to quantitatively integrate the convective-diffusion-reaction processes occurring on the systemic scale, with the molecular signaling processes occurring on the cellular and subcellular scales. In this study, we reviewed the current state of the art in cancer modeling across multiple length scales, with an emphasis on the integration of intracellular signal transduction models with pro-tumorigenic chemical and mechanical microenvironmental cues. First, we reviewed the underlying biomolecular origin of breast cancer, with a special emphasis on angiogenesis. Then, we summarized the development of tissue engineering platforms which could provide high-fidelity ex  vivo experimental models to identify and validate multiscale simulations. Lastly, we reviewed top-down and bottom-up multiscale strategies that integrate subcellular networks with the microenvironment. We present models of a variety of cancers, in addition to breast cancer specific models. Taken together, we expect  as the sophistication of the simulations increase, that multiscale modeling and bottom-up agent-based models in particular will become an increasingly important  platform technology for basic scientific discovery, as well as the identification and validation of potentially novel therapeutic targets.',\n",

Moreover, the  anti-angiogenic and anti-invasiveness effects of green tea were revealed as reductions of both vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-7 mRNA expression levels. These effects were confirmed by the significant reduction of serum tumour necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein levels, inhibition of tumour incidence, and nearly normal survival rate and colonic architecture.

Tracheoesophageal puncture is the gold standard for voice restoration. But it still has prosthesis-related problems. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: We designed a uniquely customized radial forearm free flap (RFFF), which also incorporated a region for phonation tube (PT) creation, for the dual purpose of circumferential laryngopharyngeal defect reconstruction and voice production. METHODS: From August 2005 to September 2010, there were 18 male patients with late-stage hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) or laryngeal cancer (LC) who received one-stage reconstruction with the fabricated RFFF-accompanying PT after total pharyngolaryngectomy. We recorded the phonation outcome of phonation efficacy (PE) and maximal phonation time (MPT) postoperatively within 1 month and at least 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: Nine patients suffered from HPC and the others suffered from LC. Twelve patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy after surgery. The follow-up time was 12 to 56 months (mean 28.7 months). There was no  significant variance in the PE (79.72%, SD=21.93% vs. 62.50%, SD=39.60%, respectively; p = 0.115) and MPT (2.58 seconds, SD=1.80 vs. 2.97 seconds, SD=3.96, respectively; p = 0.878) between the first and last follow-up points, even when the patients were grouped by radiotherapy status after surgery or by disease group. CONCLUSIONS: The phonation outcome in our experience was satisfactory and it tolerated postoperative radiotherapy during at least the 12-month follow-up period.',\n",

We use conditional mutual information to search for features that satisfy conditional independence assumptions. Using this framework we incorporate kinetic feature maps derived from breast dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging as observation channels in MRF for tumor segmentation. Our algorithm based on multichannel MRF achieves an receiver operating characteristic area under curve (AUC) of 0.97 for  tumor segmentation when using a radiologist's manual delineation as ground truth. Single channel MRF based on the best feature chosen from the same pool of features as used by the multichannel MRF achieved a lower AUC of 0.89. We also present a comparison against the well established normalized cuts segmentation algorithm along with commonly used approaches for breast tumor segmentation including fuzzy C-means (FCM) and the more recent method of running FCM on enhancement variance features (FCM-VES). These previous methods give a lower AUC  of 0.92, 0.88, and 0.60, respectively. Finally, we also investigate the role of superior segmentation in feature extraction and tumor characterization. Specifically, we examine the effect of improved segmentation on predicting the probability of breast cancer recurrence as determined by a validated tumor gene expression assay.

These mechanisms  include direct selection of clonal cell populations with the capacity to rapidly  upregulate alternative proangiogenic pathways, increased invasive capacity, and intrinsic resistance to hypoxia. The implications of normalization of vasculature with subsequently improved vascular function as a result of antiangiogenic therapy are explored, as are the implications of the ability to incorporate and co-opt otherwise normal vasculature. Finally, we consider the extent to which a better understanding of the biology of hypoxia and reoxygenation, as well as the  depth and breadth of systems invested in angiogenesis, may offer putative biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.

Two thirds of the patients were randomly assigned to the training set (n = 5,300), and one third were assigned to the validation set (n = 2,654). Multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazards regression was performed using  the training set, and the nomogram was constructed. Discrimination and calibration were performed using the SNUH validation set. Additional external validation was performed using the data set (n = 2,500) from Cancer Institute Ariake Hospital (CIAH) in Tokyo, Japan. RESULTS: The multivariate Cox model identified age at diagnosis, sex, location, depth of invasion, number of metastatic lymph nodes, and number of examined lymph nodes as covariates associated with survival. In the SNUH validation set, the nomogram exhibited superior discrimination power compared with the seventh American Joint Committee  on Cancer TNM classification (Harrell's C-index, 0.78 v 0.69, respectively; P < .001).

The number of patients with SMNs is growing, with new SMNs now representing about one in six of all cancers reported  to the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. SMNs reflect not only the late effects of therapy but also the influence of shared etiologic factors (in particular, tobacco and excessive alcohol intake), genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures, host effects, and combinations of factors, including gene-environment interactions. For selected SMNs, risk is also modified by age at exposure and attained age. SMNs can be categorized into three major groups according to the predominant etiologic factor(s): (1) treatment-related, (2) syndromic, and (3) those due to shared etiologic exposures, although the nonexclusivity of these groups should be underscored. Here we provide an overview of SMNs in survivors of adult-onset cancer, summarizing the current, albeit limited, clinical evidence with regard to screening and prevention, with a focus on the provision of guidance for health care providers.

This review examines the evidence for causes, risk, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and impact of this largely unexamined survivorship concern. METHODS PubMed and Medline were searched for cancer-related LE literature published since 1990 in English. The resulting references (N = 726) were evaluated for strength of design, methods, sample size, and recent publication and sorted into categories (ie, causes/prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and QOL). Sixty studies were included. Results Exercise and physical activity and sentinel lymph node biopsy reduce risk, and overweight and obesity increase risk. Evidence that physiotherapy reduces risk and that lymph node status and number of malignant nodes increase risk is less strong. Perometry and bioimpedence emerged as attractive diagnostic technologies, replacing the use of water displacement in clinical practice. Swelling can also be assessed by measuring arm circumference and relying on self-report. Symptoms can be managed, not cured, with complex physical therapy, low-level laser therapy, pharmacotherapy, and surgery. Sequelae of LE negatively affect physical and mental QOL and range in severity. However, the majority of reviewed studies involved patients with breast cancer; therefore, results may not be applicable to all cancers. CONCLUSION Research into causes, prevention, and effect on QOL of LE and information on LE in cancers other than breast is needed. Consensus on definitions and measurement, increased patient and provider awareness of signs and symptoms, and proper and prompt treatment/access, including psychosocial support, are needed to better understand, prevent, and treat LE.',\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a prospective cohort design and multivariate modeling to investigate factors related to noninitiation of chemotherapy among women with newly diagnosed breast cancer recruited from three  US sites. We interviewed patients at baseline and during treatment on sociodemographic, tumor, and treatment decision-making factors. Patients were categorized according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines as those for whom chemotherapy was definitely indicated, clinically discretionary, or discretionary based on age greater than 70 years. RESULTS: Of 1,145 patients recruited, chemotherapy was clinically indicated for 392 patients, clinically discretionary for 459 patients, discretionary because of age for 169 patients, and not indicated for 93 patients; data were insufficient for 32 patients. Chemotherapy rates were 90% for those in whom chemotherapy was clinically indicated, 36% for those in whom it was discretionary because of clinical factors, and 19% for those in whom it was discretionary based on age greater than 70 years. Nonreceipt of chemotherapy was associated with older age, more negative beliefs about treatment efficacy, less positive beliefs about chemotherapy, and more concern about adverse effects. In the two discretionary groups, clinical predictors of worse outcome (greater tumor size, positive nodes, worse grade, and estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative status) were associated with increased chemotherapy initiation. CONCLUSION: Utilization of adjuvant chemotherapy was most common among patients who, based on clinical criteria, would most likely benefit from it, patients with more positive than negative beliefs regarding treatment efficacy, and patients with few concerns about adverse effects.',\n",

Medical providers who participate in the care of cancer survivors should be aware that various cancer treatments may cause bone loss, which can increase the risk of subsequent of osteoporosis. Healthy bone remodeling is a balanced and dynamic  equation between new bone formation and bone resorption. Aging, natural menopause, and cancer treatments such as surgical oophorectomy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure, androgen deprivation therapy, and aromatase inhibitors can all promote bone loss. The WHO Fracture Assessment Tool can be used as a clinical aid to assess an individual's osteoporotic fracture risk, with or without bone mineral density measurements obtained from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Preventative strategies include adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation and modifying risk factors such as alcohol intake, tobacco use, and lack of exercise.

Currently, only scarce information on the association between tumor grade and VTE is available. We thus evaluated the role of tumor grade and its association with  VTE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study is a prospective, observational cohort study including patients with newly diagnosed cancer or progression of disease after remission. Study end point is the occurrence of symptomatic VTE. RESULTS: Seven hundred forty-seven patients with solid tumors received follow-up for a median of 526 days. VTE occurred in 52 patients (7.0%). At study inclusion, 468 patients had low-grade tumors (G1 and G2) and 279 had high-grade tumors (G3 and G4). In multivariable Cox regression analysis including tumor grade, tumor histology, tumor sites, stage, sex, and age, patients with high-grade tumors had a significantly higher risk of VTE compared with those with low-grade tumors (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5; P = .015). The cumulative probability of developing VTE after 6 months was higher in patients with high-grade tumors than in those with low-grade tumors (8.2% v 4.0%; log-rank test P = .037). Patients with high-grade tumors had higher D-dimer levels (P = .008) and leukocyte counts (P < .001), and lower hemoglobin levels (P = .008). CONCLUSION: The tumor grade may help identify patients with cancer who are at high risk of VTE.

Long-term survival times of up to 44 months after adjuvant chemoradioimmunotherapy in phase II trials motivated the present study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2007, 132 R0/R1 resected patients received either fluorouracil (FU), cisplatin, and interferon alfa-2b (IFN alpha-2b) plus radiotherapy followed by two cycles of FU (arm A, n=64) or six cycles of FU monotherapy (arm B, n=68). One hundred ten patients (arm A, n=53; arm B, n=57) received at least one dose of the study medication, and these patients composed the per-protocol (PP) population. Biomarkers were analyzed longitudinally for their predictive value. RESULTS: Median survival for all randomly assigned patients was 26.5 months (95% CI, 21.6 to 39.5 months) in arm A and 28.5 months (95% CI, 20.4 to 38.6 months) in arm B. The hazard ratio was 1.04 (arm A v arm B: 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.53; P=.99). Median survival for the PP population was 32.1 months (95% CI, 22.8 to 42.2 months) in arm A and 28.5 months (95% CI, 19.5 to 38.6 months) in arm B (P=.49). Eighty-five percent of patients in arm A and 16% of patients in arm B experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity. The quality of life was temporarily negatively affected in arm A. CONCLUSION: The FU, cisplatin, and IFN alpha-2b plus radiotherapy regimen did not improve the survival compared with FU monotherapy. Given the substantial adverse effects, this treatment can currently not be recommended. Nevertheless, the outcome in both arms represents the best survival, to our knowledge, ever reported for patients with resected pancreatic cancer in randomized controlled trials.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Academic institution. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Retrospective review of 18 consecutive robotic thyroid lobectomies performed from February 2010 to April 2012 involving 16 female patients. Two patients underwent robot-assisted completion thyroidectomy a few months following the initial thyroid surgery, one for cancer and the other for goiter. RESULTS: Median age was 47.5 years (range, 18-62 years), and median body mass index was 28.7 (range, 19.4-44.5). Median thyroid nodule size was 2.9 cm (range, 1.1-4.7 cm). All but 1 case (6%) was performed successfully via single axillary incision. There was no conversion to an open approach. Median operative  time was 170 minutes (range, 95-220 minutes), and median blood loss was 12.5 mL (range, 5-75 mL). Complications occurred in 4 cases (22%) to include temporary vocal cord pareses (n = 3) and a postoperative hematoma that required exploration. Median hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-3 days). CONCLUSION: Single-incision transaxillary robotic thyroidectomy can be technically challenging in North American patients with a larger body frame due to difficulty in optimal placement of all 4 robotic instruments via a single axillary incision. All 3 cases of temporary vocal cord paresis occurred early in our experience and  may have been due to our relative inexperience with this new approach and associated instrumentation.

The purpose of this study is to project prostate  cancer mortality under active surveillance followed by radical prostatectomy versus under immediate radical prostatectomy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A simulation model was developed to combine information on time from diagnosis to treatment under active surveillance and associated disease progression from a Johns Hopkins active surveillance cohort (n = 769), time from radical prostatectomy to recurrence from cases in the CaPSURE database with T-stage </= T2a (n = 3,470), and time from recurrence to prostate cancer death from a T-stage </= T2a Johns Hopkins cohort of patients whose disease recurred after radical prostatectomy (n  = 963). Results were projected for a hypothetical cohort aged 40 to 90 years with low-risk prostate cancer (T-stage </= T2a, Gleason score </= 6, and prostate-specific antigen level </= 10 ng/mL). RESULTS: The model projected that  2.8% of men on active surveillance and 1.6% of men with immediate radical prostatectomy would die of their disease in 20 years. Corresponding lifetime estimates were 3.4% for active surveillance and 2.0% for immediate radical prostatectomy. The average projected increase in life expectancy associated with  immediate radical prostatectomy was 1.8 months. On average, the model projected that men on active surveillance would remain free of treatment for an additional  6.4 years relative to men treated immediately.

METHODS: We selectively reviewed the literature from 1990 to 2012 and  evaluated original articles and reviews retrieved from the PubMed database, as well as the recommendations of the following specialty societies: the German Societies of Endocrinology and Nuclear Medicine (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Endokrinologie, Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Nuklearmedizin), the German Working Group for Endocrine Surgery (Chirurgische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Endokrinologie, CAEK), the European Thyroid Association, and the American Thyroid Association. RESULTS: There have been very few randomized trials concerning the diagnosis and  treatment of goiter. Nodular goiter can be managed by watchful waiting, drug treatment (initially with levothyroxine and iodide), radioactive iodine therapy,  or surgery. CONCLUSION: Many patients with nodules need no treatment at all. Treatment is indicated, however, if the patient is symptomatic and/or has an autonomously functioning (\"hot\") nodule, or if cancer is suspected. Potentially cancerous nodules must be operated on. If euthyroid nodular goiter is to be treated with the main goal of size reduction, either surgery or radioactive iodine therapy can be used. Drug treatment is an option for small nodules or goiters, but iatrogenic hyperthyroidism must be avoided at all costs. The type of follow-up that is required depends on the chosen treatment.',\n",

We investigated the effect of a novel, controlled-release form of a bioactive lipid, cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA), on  human colon cancer cell line functions. We encapsulated cPA in gelatin-based hydrogels and examined its ability to inhibit the viability and migration of HT-29 and DLD-1 cells in vitro and the LPA-induced activity of the transcription  factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The hydrogel delivery system prolonged cPA release into the culture medium. Accordingly, cPA-hydrogel microspheres substantially inhibited LPA-induced PPARgamma activity  and cell growth and migration compared with that of cells cultured with cPA alone. Thus, hydrogel microspheres are a potential system for stable and efficient delivery of bioactive lipids such as cPA and may offer a new strategy for targeted colon cancer treatment.',\n",

Our research proposed four aims: 1) to gather more concise data  about the smoking habits of lung cancer patients; 2) to demonstrate the relationship between the quantitative indicator pack year index (PYI) of smoking  history and survival; 3) to test the hypothesis that smoking is not only a risk factor, but also a prognostic factor in lung cancer survival; and 4) to assess the survival advantage of smoking cessation at the time of diagnosis among lung cancer patients. We employed a questionnaire based prospective cohort design of lung cancer patients diagnosed in Budapest, 2009. We collected data on the method of cancer detection, cell types, stage, treatment, comorbidities and smoking habits at baseline. Follow-up questionnaires were completed to document changes (survival, smoking habits) every six months. Our sample included 929 patients (521 males and 408 females). The majority had a history of smoking (79%), including 68% current and 32% former smokers. The average PYI was 33. Fifty-seven % of current smokers quit at the time of lung cancer diagnosis (3% relapsed) and  43% continued smoking. The 30-month survival probabilities were found to be as follows: smokers who had PYI</=39: 44%; PYI>/=40: 35%. PYI </=39 vs. >/=40 [HR=1.26, 95% CI 1.02 1.64; p=0.045]. The 30-month survival proved to be significantly better for those patients who quit at the time of diagnosis (quitters: 54% vs. continuous smokers: 42% [HR=1.29, 95% CI 1.12 1.78; p<0.001]). The benefit of quitting smoking was observed both in the surgically resected and  the not resected group. Our results demonstrate that smoking is not only a risk factor for lung cancer, but also a strong prognostic factor of survival at 30 months after diagnosis. Survival is also significantly influenced by the smoking  history (PYI). It is markedly important for smoking patients to quit smoking at the time of diagnosis.',\n",

Between January 2001 and March 2011, at ten patients with prostate cancer the clinical target volumes (CTVs) for prostate (CTV-PROS), and prostate plus caudal 1 cm of seminal vesicles (CTV-PVS) with or without pelvic lymph node region were contoured on the treatment planning CT, according to risk category of the patient. Planning target volumes (PTVs) were created with 1 cm margin extended around the CTVs in each direction. The isocentre was marked on the skin with three radiopaque markers. After the set up, treatment couch with the patient was turned by 180 degree and images were acquired of the region of the isocentre with a kV helical CT-on-rails system (treatment CT). An image registration software was used to co-register planning and treatment CT images. Automatic CT image co-registration was followed by manual co-registration taking into account the CTV-PROS contour and soft tissue informations. Deviations of the isocentres in lateral (LAT), longitudinal (LONG)  and vertical (VERT) directions were recorded after each image co-registration. Corresponding data were compared using the t-probe. Systematic (S) and random (s) errors of the set up were calculated. Adequate PTV to CTV margins were calculated by van Herk's formula (2.5xS + 0,7xs). Overall 252 deviations were analysed on fourty-two CT series of 10 patients. The mean errors of the set up with automatic and manual image co-registrations were 0.19 cm and 0.07 cm (p=0.001) in LAT, 0.05 cm and 0.03 cm (p=0.07) in LONG and 0.16 cm and 0.22 cm (p=0.16) in VERT directions, respectively. The systematic errors of the set up for automatic and manual image registrations were 0.22 cm and 0.26 cm in LAT, 0.17 cm and 0.18 cm in LONG, 0.25 cm and 0.26 cm in VERT directions, respectively. The random errors  of the set up for automatic and manual image registrations were 0.31 cm and 0.26  cm in LAT, 0.27 cm and 0.27 cm in LONG and 0.24 cm and 0.33 cm in VERT directions, respectively. In case of manual image co-registration, the required PTV to CTV margins to cover at least 95% of the CTVs with at least 95% percent of the prescribed dose were calculated to 0.93 cm in LAT, 0.65 cm in LONG, and 0.89  cm in VERT directions. Patients set up can be verified with manual image co-registration based on soft tissues around the prostate using a kV CT-on-rails  system installed in the treatment room. The difference between automatic and manual image co-registration was significant in LAT direction. A PTV to CTV margin <1 cm seems to be appropriate to cover the CTVs in image-guided prostate radiotherapy. These findings support our recent clinical protocol.\",\n",

According to these studies, nintedanib effectively inhibits VEGFR-, PDGFR- and FGFR signalization and thus the proliferation and survival of cell types which highly  express these receptors (i.e. endothelial and smooth muscle cells and pericytes). In vitro studies and in vivo xenograft experiments have provided promising results. In the clinical setting, BIBF 1120 seems to be effective and well tolerated in various tumor types, such as lung, prostate, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as in gynecological tumors. The main adverse events are gastrointestinal toxicities and the reversible elevation of liver enzyme levels. Nintedanib might also be combined with paclitaxel, carboplatin, pemetrexed and docetaxel.

In the active state, Ras proteins interact with and modulate the activity of several downstream effectors regulating key cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence, migration and metabolism. Activating mutations of RAS genes and of genes encoding Ras signaling members have a great incidence in proliferative disorders, such as  cancer, immune and inflammatory diseases and developmental syndromes. Therefore,  Ras and Ras signaling represent important clinical targets for the design and development of pharmaceutically active agents, including anticancer agents. AREAS COVERED: The authors summarize methods available to down-regulate the Ras pathway and review recent patents covering Ras signaling modulators, as well as methods designed to kill specifically cancer cells bearing activated RAS oncogene. EXPERT OPINION: Targeted therapy approach based on direct targeting of molecules specifically altered in Ras-dependent diseases is pursued with molecules that down-regulate expression or inhibit the biological function of mutant Ras or Ras  signaling members. The low success rate in a clinical setting of molecules targeting activated members of the Ras pathway may require development of novel approaches, including combined and synthetic lethal therapies.',\n",

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether telomere length and genes involved in maintaining telomere length are altered in FNMTC. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 44 members (13 affected and 31 unaffected) of six families with FNMTC and from 60 controls. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and reverse transcription PCR were performed to analyze relative telomere length (RTL), gene copy number, and mRNA expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), telomere repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1), telomere repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2), repressor activator protein 1 (RAP1), TRF1 interacting nuclear factor 2 (TIN2), tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), and protection of telomere 1 (POT1). RESULTS: Affected members had shorter RTL, as compared with unaffected members (0.98 vs. 1.23, p<0.01). There was no significant difference in hTERT, TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1, and POT1 gene copy number or mRNA expression between affected and unaffected members. CONCLUSIONS: RTL is shorter in affected members with FNMTC but is not associated  with altered copy number or expression in hTERT, TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1, and POT1. The small differences in RTL preclude the utility of RTL as a marker for FNMTC in at-risk individuals.',\n",

The National Cancer Institute-funded Chicago Patient Navigation Research Program (C-PNRP) aims to implement and evaluate the efficacy of a patient navigation intervention for predominantly low-income minority patients with an abnormal prostate cancer screening test at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital in Chicago. METHODS/DESIGN: From 2006 through 2010, C-PNRP implemented a quasi-experimental intervention whereby trained social worker and lay health navigators worked with veterans with an abnormal prostate screen to proactively identify and resolve personal and systems barriers to care. Men were enrolled at a VA urology clinic and were selected to receive navigated versus usual care based on clinic day. Patient navigators performed activities to facilitate timely follow-up such as appointment reminders, transportation coordination, cancer education, scheduling  assistance, and social support as needed. Primary outcome measures included time  (days) from abnormal screening to diagnosis and time from diagnosis to treatment  initiation. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial and demographic predictors of non-compliance and patient satisfaction. Dates of screening, follow-up visits, and treatment were obtained through chart audit, and questionnaires were administered at baseline, after diagnosis, and after treatment initiation. At the VA, 546 patients were enrolled in the study (245 in the navigated arm, 245 in the records-based control arm, and 56 in a subsample of surveyed control subjects). DISCUSSION: Given increasing concerns about balancing better health outcomes with lower costs, careful examination of interventions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities attain critical importance. While analysis of the C-PNRP data is underway, the design of this patient navigation intervention will inform other patient navigation programs addressing strategies to improve prostate cancer outcomes among vulnerable populations.',\n",

ATF4 expression is increased in response  to a diverse array of microenvironmental stresses including amino acid depletion, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that are sensed by upstream eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) kinases. In  tumours, ATF4 expression is detected in hypoxic- and nutrient-deprived regions where it promotes metabolic homeostasis and cancer cell survival by transcriptionally regulating amino acid uptake and biosynthesis, autophagy, redox balance and angiogenesis. AREAS COVERED: The mechanism governing translational expression of ATF4 is discussed along with the physiological roles of ATF4 in growth and development. Conditions that result in ATF4 expression in tumours are  described with a focus on the role of ATF4 in cancer progression and treatment resistance. Several approaches to target ATF4 are presented including strategies  aimed at inhibiting transcriptional activity or increasing degradation, approaches to reduce ATF4 translation by inhibiting upstream eIF2alpha kinases and targeting of downstream pathways that are regulated by ATF4 including amino acid biosynthesis, ER-associated degradation and autophagy.

The long term follow up of eight patients highlights the clinical  heterogeneity of this disease as well as the main therapeutic approaches and remaining challenges in the light of the recent development of new CXCR4 inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the natural history of WS based on a French cohort of 8 patients. METHODS: We have reviewed the clinical, biological and immunological features of patients with WS enrolled into the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry. RESULTS: We identified four pedigrees with WS comprised of eight patients and one foetus. Estimated incidence for WS was of 0.23 per million births. Median age at the last visit was 29 years. Three  pedigrees encompassing seven patients and the fetus displayed autosomal dominant  heterozygous mutations of the CXCR4 gene, while one patient presented a wild-type CXCR4 gene. Two subjects exhibited congenital conotruncal heart malformations. In addition to neutropenia and myelokathexis, all patients presented deep monocytopenia and lymphopenia. Seven patients presented repeated bacterial Ears Nose Throat as well as severe bacterial infections that were curable with antibiotics. Four patients with late onset prophylaxis developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two patients reported atypical mycobacteria infections which in one case may have been responsible for one patient's death due to liver failure at the age of 40.6 years. HPV-related disease manifested in  five subjects and progressed as invasive vulvar carcinoma with a fatal course in  one patient at the age of 39.5 years. In addition, two patients developed T cell  lymphoma skin cancer and basal cell carcinoma at the age of 38 and 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous prophylactic anti-infective measures, when started in early childhood, seem to effectively prevent further bacterial infections and the consequent development of COPD. Long-term follow up is needed to evaluate the effect of early anti-HPV targeted prophylaxis on the development of skin and genital warts.\",\n",

However, it is unclear whether epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation involve in the response to the EGFR-TKI therapy. METHODS: Tumor samples from 155 patients with stages IIIB to IV NSCLC who received EGFR-TKI therapy were analyzed for DNA methylation status of Wnt antagonist genes, including SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP5, DKK3, WIF1, and APC, using methylation specific PCR (MSP) method. EGFR mutations detections were performed in the same tissues samples using Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC). RESULTS: We found that Wnt antagonists tend to methylate  simultaneously. Methylation of sFRP1 and sFRP5 are reversely correlated with EGFR mutation (P = 0.005, P = 0.011). However, no correlations of methylations of other Wnt antagonist genes with EGFR mutation were found. The patients with methylated SFRP5 have a significant shorter progression free survival than those  with unmethylated SFRP5 in response to EGFR-TKI treatment (P = 0.002), which is independent of EGFR genotype.

In this study, we investigated the features of the drainage pathways detected with the ICGf navigation system and the order of metastasis in axillary nodes. From April 2008  to February 2010, 145 patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer underwent SLN surgery with ICGf navigation. The video-recorded data from 79 patients were used for lymphatic mapping analysis. We analyzed 145 patients with  clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent SLN surgery with the ICGf navigation system. Fluorescence-positive SLNs were identified in 144 (99%) of 145 patients. Both single and multiple routes to the axilla were identified in 47% of cases using video-recorded lymphatic mapping data. An internal mammary route was  detected in 6% of the cases. Skip metastasis to the second or third SLNs was observed in 6 of the 28 node-positive patients. We also examined the strategy of  axillary surgery using the ICGf navigation system. We found that, based on the features of nodal involvement, 4-node resection could provide precise information on the nodal status. The ICGf navigation system may provide a different lymphatic mapping result than computed tomography lymphography in clinically node-negative  breast cancer patients. Furthermore, it enables the identification of lymph nodes that do not accumulate indocyanine green or dye adjacent to the SLNs in the sequence of drainage. Knowledge of the order of nodal metastasis as revealed by the ICGf system may help to personalize the surgical treatment of axilla in SLN-positive cases, although additional studies are required.',\n",

Frequently, growing prostatic tumor cells extend beyond the prostatic organ towards this fat depot. This study  aimed to determine the genome-wide expression of genes in PP adipose tissue in obesity/overweight (OB/OW) and prostate cancer patients. METHODS: Differentially  expressed genes in human PP adipose tissue were identified using microarrays. Analyses were conducted according to the donors' body mass index characteristics  (OB/OW versus lean) and prostate disease (extra prostatic cancer versus organ confined prostate cancer versus benign prostatic hyperplasia). Selected genes with altered expression were validated by real-time PCR. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to investigate gene ontology, canonical pathways and functional networks. RESULTS: In the PP adipose tissue of OB/OW subjects, we found altered expression of genes encoding molecules involved in adipogenic/anti-lipolytic, proliferative/anti-apoptotic, and mild immunoinflammatory processes (for example, FADS1, down-regulated, and LEP and ANGPT1, both up-regulated). Conversely, in the PP adipose tissue of subjects with prostate cancer, altered genes were related to adipose tissue cellular activity (increased cell proliferation/differentiation, cell cycle activation and anti-apoptosis), whereas a downward impact on immunity and inflammation was also  observed, mostly related to the complement (down-regulation of CFH). Interestingly, we found that the microRNA MIRLET7A2 was overexpressed in the PP adipose tissue of prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and excess adiposity modified the expression of PP adipose tissue genes to ultimately foster fat mass growth. In patients with prostate cancer the expression profile of PP adipose tissue accounted for hypercellularity and reduced immunosurveillance. Both findings may be liable to promote a favorable environment for prostate cancer progression.\",\n",

STUDY DESIGN: Linked study of 3 databases (Taiwan Cancer Registry, National Health Insurance [NHI] claim database, and death registry database). METHODS: Outpatient shopping behavior was defined as making at least 4 or 5 physician visits to confirm a cancer diagnosis. We analyzed patient-related factors and the 5-year overall survival rate of the outpatient-shopping group compared with a nonshopping group. Using the household  registration database and NHI database, we determined the proportion of outpatient shopping, characteristics of patients who did and did not shop for outpatient therapy, time between diagnosis and start of regular treatment, and medical service utilization in the shopping versus the nonshopping group. RESULTS: Patients with higher incomes were significantly more likely to shop for  outpatient care. Patients with higher comorbidity scores were 1.4 times more likely to shop for outpatient care than patients with lower scores. Patients diagnosed with more advanced cancer were more likely to shop than those who were  not. Patients might be more trusting of cancer diagnoses given at higher-level hospitals. The nonshopping groups had a longer duration of survival over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Health authorities should consider charging additional fees after a  specific outpatient- shopping threshold is reached to reduce this behavior. The government may need to reassess the function of the medical sources network by shrinking it from the original 4 levels to 2 levels, or by enhancing the referral function among different hospital levels.',\n",

In non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), Hoechst 33342 dye effluxing side population (SP) cells are shown to have stem cell like properties. The oncogenic capacity of cancer stem-like cells is in part due to their ability to self-renew; however the mechanistic correlation between oncogenic pathways and self-renewal of cancer stem-like cells has remained elusive. Here we characterized the SP cells at the molecular level and evaluated  its ability to generate tumors at the orthotopic site in the lung microenvironment. Further, we investigated if the self-renewal of SP cells is dependent on EGFR mediated signaling. RESULTS: SP cells were detected and isolated from multiple NSCLC cell lines (H1650, H1975, A549), as well as primary  human tumor explants grown in nude mice. SP cells demonstrated stem-like properties including ability to self-renew and grow as spheres; they were able to generate primary and metastatic tumors upon orthotopic implantation into the lung of SCID mice. In vitro study revealed elevated expression of stem cell associated markers like Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog as well as demonstrated intrinsic epithelial to mesenchymal transition features in SP cells. Further, we show that abrogation of  EGFR, Src and Akt signaling through pharmacological or genetic inhibitors suppresses the self-renewal growth and expansion of SP-cells and resulted in specific downregulation of Sox2 protein expression. siRNA mediated depletion of Sox2 significantly blocked the SP phenotype as well as its self-renewal capacity; whereas other transcription factors like Oct4 and Nanog played a relatively lesser role in regulating self-renewal. Interestingly, Sox2 was elevated in metastatic foci of human NSCLC samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Sox2 is a novel target of EGFR-Src-Akt signaling in NSCLCs that modulates self-renewal and expansion of stem-like cells from NSCLC. Therefore, the outcome  of the EGFR-Src-Akt targeted therapy may rely upon the expression and function of Sox2 within the NSCLC-CSCs.',\n",

RESULTS: The complete coding region  of the K-ras gene and exon 3 and exon 4 of the beta-catenin gene isolated from tumor tissues and adjacent normal colon tissues from 117 CRC subjects were sequenced, respectively. Methylations in the RASSF1A promoter region were also investigated. Various characteristics of the 117 subjects were recorded and used  in the Cox proportional-hazard model analyses. Three missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, and one deletion were identified in the beta-catenin gene. A 2 bp deletion was identified in the K-ras gene. We found that the frequencies of mutations in the beta-catenin and K-ras genes were less pronounced in Taiwanese CRC subjects as compared with other populations. Methylations in the RASSF1A promoter region were detected in 73.5% (n=86/117) of the subjects, which was higher than in other studies. Methylations in the RASSF1A promoter have no significant effect on hazards for all CRC deaths caused in Taiwanese CRC patients. No interaction between 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy and methylations of the RASSF1A promoter was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The mutation frequencies of beta-catenin and K-ras genes in Taiwanese CRC patients are very low, which may suggest that they are not the dominant factors for CRC occurrence and prognosis in Taiwanese CRC patients. Methylation of RASSF1A promoter is independent of the  prognosis for Taiwanese CRC patients.

       " '23009638': {'AB': 'BACKGROUND: In this work a mathematical model describing the growth of a solid tumour in the presence of an immune system response is presented. Specifically, attention is focused on the interactions between cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and tumour cells in a small, avascular multicellular tumour. At this stage of the disease the CTLs and the tumour cells are considered to be in a state of dynamic  equilibrium or cancer dormancy. The precise biochemical and cellular mechanisms by which CTLs can control a cancer and keep it in a dormant state are still not completely understood from a biological and immunological point of view. The mathematical model focuses on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour cells, immune cells, chemokines and \"chemorepellents\" in an immunogenic tumour. The CTLs and tumour cells are assumed to migrate and interact with each other in such a way that lymphocyte-tumour cell complexes are formed. These complexes result in either the death of the tumour cells (the normal situation) or the inactivation of the lymphocytes and consequently the survival of the tumour cells. In the latter case, we assume that each tumour cell that survives its \"brief encounter\"  with the CTLs undergoes certain beneficial phenotypic changes. RESULTS: We explore the dynamics of the model under these assumptions and show that the process of immuno-evasion can arise as a consequence of these encounters. We show that the proposed mechanism not only shape the dynamics of the total number of tumor cells and of CTLs, but also the dynamics of their spatial distribution. We  also briefly discuss the evolutionary features of our model, by framing them in the recent quasi-Lamarckian theories. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings might have some interesting implication of interest for clinical practice.

       " '23009663': {'AB': \"BACKGROUND: We previously observed that a radiotherapy-induced biochemical response in plasma was associated with favourable outcome in head and neck squamous carcinoma cancer (HNSCC) patients. The aim of the present study was to compare stress associated blood cell gene expression between two sub-groups of HNSCC patients with different biochemical responses to radiotherapy. METHODS: Out of 87 patients (histologically verified), 10 biochemical 'responders' having a high relative increase in plasma oxidative damage and a concomitant decrease in plasma antioxidants during radiotherapy and 10 'poor-responders' were selected for gene-expression analysis and compared using gene set enrichment analysis. RESULTS: There was a significant induction of stress-relevant gene-sets in the responders following radiotherapy compared to the poor-responders. The relevance  of the involvement of similar stress associated gene expression for HNSCC cancer  and radioresistance was verified using two publicly available data sets of 42 HNSCC cases and 14 controls (GEO GSE6791), and radiation resistant and radiation  sensitive HNSCC xenografts (E-GEOD-9716). CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy induces a systemic stress response, as revealed by induction of stress relevant gene expression in blood cells, which is associated to favourable outcome in a cohort  of 87 HNSCC patients. Whether these changes in gene expression reflects a systemic effect or are biomarkers of the tumour micro-environmental status needs  further study.

       " '23009688': {'AB': 'CONTEXT: Radioactive iodine is a crucial tool for treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). In 5% of cases, DTCs lose I-131 avidity and assume an aggressive behaviour. Treatment options for iodine-refractory DTC are limited. We report the experience of off-label use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib for treatment of advanced iodine-refractory DTC. DESIGN: Patients with progressive DTC refractory to radioactive iodine were treated with sorafenib used off-label independently from their performance status. Primary study end-points were radiological response, progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Secondary end-points were site-specific radiological response and overall survival (OS). An exploratory analysis of the role of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was performed. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were included in the study. Median follow-up was  15.5 months. Clinical benefit was obtained in 71% of subjects (30% partial response and 41% stable disease). Sorafenib was mostly well tolerated, but a high incidence of fatal events was reported (three patients died from severe bleeding  events and two from cardiac arrest). Median PFS was 9 months. Median OS was 10 months. The best responses were observed in lymph nodes and lung. Baseline Tg levels and the Tg response to treatment were correlated to both radiological response and PFS. Baseline FDG-PET assessment and early FDG-PET response were correlated to radiological response. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib allows morphological  disease control in the majority of patients with iodine-refractory DTC. Progression-free survival and overall survival were lower than in previous studies as a consequence of the worse clinical condition of our patients. Sorafenib is mostly well tolerated but could have been responsible for the reported fatal events. Baseline Tg and the Tg response to treatment could be useful for predicting morphological response and clinical outcome. Early FDG-PET  response could be helpful for the timely identification of nonresponding patients.',\n",

METHODS: 103 patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC were treated with B (15 mg/kg day 1 of each 21-day cycle) and E (150 mg daily) until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Upon PD patients received 6 cycles of CT (cisplatin/carboplatin and gemcitabine). The primary endpoint was disease stabilization rate (DSR) after 12 weeks of BE treatment. RESULTS: 101 patients were evaluable. Under BE, DSR at week 12 was 54.5%. 73 patients had at least stable disease (SD), including 1 complete remission and 17 partial responses (PR). No unexpected toxicities were observed. Median time to progression (TTP) under BE was 4.1 months. 62 patients started CT; 35 received at least 4 cycles (6 PR, 32 SD). At a median follow-up of 36 months, median overall survival (OS) was  14.1 months.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with stage I NSCLC underwent pre-SABR PET at simulation and/or post-SABR PET within 6 months. We analyzed maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) and metabolic tumor volume defined using several thresholds (MTV50%, or MTV2, 4, 7, and 10). Endpoints included primary tumor control (PTC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). We performed Kaplan-Meier, competing risk, and Cox proportional hazards survival analyses. RESULTS: Patients received 25-60 Gy in 1 to 5 fractions. Median follow-up time was 13.2 months. The 1-year estimated PTC, PFS, OS and CSS were 100, 83, 87 and 94%, respectively. Pre-treatment SUV(max) (p=0.014), MTV(7) (p=0.0077), and MTV(10) (p=0.0039) correlated significantly with OS. In the low-MTV(7)vs. high-MTV(7) sub-groups, 1-year estimated OS was 100 vs. 78% (p=0.0077) and CSS was 100 vs. 88% (p=0.082). CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis-generating study we identified multiple pre-treatment PET-CT metrics as potential predictors of OS and CSS in patients with NSCLC treated with SABR.

The aim of this study was to examine if tumor size could predict survival length in order to optimize patient care. METHODS: A retrospective observational  study was performed on 185 consecutive patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer (ICD10: C250-2 and C258) who were diagnosed from 2003 to May 2010. The patients' initial radiographs at presentation of symptoms were reviewed by the same radiologist, and tumor extent was determined. RESULTS: The largest tumor diameter of the primary tumor was measured in 132 patients, 22 by an ultrasound and the other patients by a CT scan. In 53 patients, the tumor size could not be  delimited and measured. Seventy-five patients (41%) had liver metastases at presentation of symptoms. Median survival for the entire patient group was only 119 days. The median diameter of the patient's largest tumor was 4.35 cm, while the sample groups ranged from 1.2 to 14 cm. Patients were divided into two groups: those with a largest tumor diameter of </= 4.3 cm (66 patients) and those with a largest tumor diameter of > 4.3 cm (66 patients). Median survival for these groups was 149 and 94 days (p = 0.019), respectively. Cox regression showed a hazard ratio for tumor size of 1.48 (95% CI 1.02, 2.07) (p = 0.038), adjusted for the gemcitabine treatment which had been given to 49 patients and the presence of liver metastasis. In 88 patients, stricture length could be measured  at ERCP. When comparing stricture lengths of </= 2 cm and > 2 cm, no difference in survival time was noted within a Kaplan-Meier analysis. CONCLUSION: The size of the maximum tumor diameter of the primary tumor during the initial X-ray examination of patients with pancreatic cancer may predict survival time for those patients who had no surgical resection. Stricture length at ERCP gave no information on survival.\",\n",

RESULTS: Hematologic, gastrointestinal, breast, and lung cancers were the most common. Mean age was 51.5 years; 51% were female. 74% of patients with solid tumors had metastatic disease. Treatment approaches were palliative chemotherapy, followed by curative chemotherapy and best supportive care. The most common symptoms were fatigue, appetite loss, nausea, and pain; most distressing were nausea, pain, and fatigue. Nausea and vomiting were more prevalent among females  than males. Females reported more severe vomiting than males, but males had more  intense pain. Overall symptom burden difference was statistically significant across age groups, with the 51-60 year group having the most symptoms, but not among different genders. Difference was significant among different treatment intents, with the best supportive care group having most symptoms. CONCLUSION: Fatigue should be better addressed as a legitimate symptom.

       " '23009866': {'AB': 'PURPOSE: A key barrier to identifying tissue biomarkers of clear cell renal cell  carcinoma is the heterogeneity of protein expression in tissue. However, by providing spectra for every 0.05 mm(2) area of tissue, imaging mass spectrometry  reveals the spatial distribution of peptides. We determined whether this approach could be used to identify and map protein signatures of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed 2 tissue microarrays with 2 cores each of matched tumor and normal tissue from the nephrectomy specimens of 70 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In  each tissue microarray peptide signatures were identified that differentiated cancer from normal tissue. The signatures were then cross validated. Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry sequencing was performed to determine the identity of select, differentially expressed peptides. Immunohistochemistry was used for validation. RESULTS: In each tissue microarray peptide signatures were identified that had 94.7% to 98.5% classification accuracy for each 0.05 mm(2) spot (spectrum) and 96.9% to 100% accuracy for each tissue core. Cross validation across tissue microarrays revealed a classification accuracy of 82.6% to 84.7% for each spot and 88.9% to 92.4% for each core. We identified vimentin, histone 2A.X and alpha-enolase as proteins with greater expression in cancer tissue. This was validated by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging mass spectrometry identified and mapped specific peptides that accurately distinguished malignant from normal renal tissue. This demonstrates its potential as a novel, high throughput approach to clear cell renal cell carcinoma biomarker discovery. Given the multiple pathways and known heterogeneity involved in tumors such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma, multiple peptide signatures that maintain their spatial relationships may outperform traditional protein biomarkers.',\n",

Cervical cancers typically distress women of middle age or older; however it may affect women in any age after the puberty. Two serotypes of HPV (16 & 18) accounts 70% of cervical cancer cases, while HPV (6 & 11) are considered low-risk viruses associated with genital warts (Condyloma acuminata) and Respiratory pappilomatosis in both gender. Generally, there is transient role of HPV in human body and are removed by immune system in or around 1 year. Data from different Pakistani hospitals provides sound evidence for increasing trends of cervical cancer, which is, being developing country imperative for us. As the cost of cancer management is increasing day by day with poor survival rate and its burden is borne by patient, their family or society in-large, so if screening or prevention is possible then  there would be need to identify target population for screening and vaccination.  By quality adjusted life year (QALY) measurement, the data from different sources indicates that adolescent age is the appropriate target population and is cost effective for vaccination. Two vaccines manufactured by recombinant DNA technology are licensed in some parts of the world for prevention of HPV related  cancers, however both have certain advantage over another, as one of the vaccines contains viral like proteins of two HPV serotypes 16 & 18 and provide additional  cross protection against HPV type 13 and 45 with 100% seroprotection, while the other vaccine, being quadrivalent offers protection against four serotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18. Both vaccines tolerability and safety profiles are similar and acceptable, however bivalent vaccine appears to provide long-lasting immunity by  the development of memory B-cells hypothetically due to difference of adsorbing agent used by manufacturer, on the other hand, quadrivalent vaccine offers protection against cervical cancer but also offers additional protection against  Condyloma acuminata and respiratory Pappilomatosis. As these vaccines are new in  the market and initial trials indicate availability of antibodies for up to around 5 years i.e. why it is controversial at the moment that whether booster dose is recommended or not, however it is assumed that, there is no harm to have  booster dose at 5th year of vaccination.',\n",

Breast cancer subtypes show divergent clinical behavior that may reflect properties inherent in their MEC compartment of origin. How the response  to a cancer-initiating genetic event is shaped by MEC subtype remains largely unexplored. Using the mouse mammary gland, we designed organotypic three-dimensional culture models that permit challenge of discrete MEC compartments with the same oncogenic insult. Mammary organoids were prepared from mice engineered for compartment-restricted coexpression of oncogenic H-RAS(G12V)  together with a nuclear fluorescent reporter. Monitoring of H-RAS(G12V)-expressing MECs during extended live cell imaging permitted visualization of Ras-driven phenotypes via video microscopy. Challenging either basal or luminal MECs with H-RAS(G12V) drove MEC proliferation and survival, culminating in aberrant organoid overgrowth. In each compartment, Ras activation  triggered modes of collective MEC migration and invasion that contrasted with physiologic modes used during growth factor-initiated branching morphogenesis. Although basal and luminal Ras activation produced similar overgrowth phenotypes, inhibitor studies revealed divergent use of Ras effector pathways. Blocking either the phosphoinositide 3-kinase or the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway completely suppressed Ras-driven invasion and overgrowth of basal MECs, but only  modestly attenuated Ras-driven phenotypes in luminal MECs. We show that MEC subtype defines signaling pathway dependencies downstream of Ras. Thus, cells-of-origin may critically determine the drug sensitivity profiles of mammary neoplasia.',\n",

Following Dlc1 inactivation, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) with a conditional Dlc1 knockout allele reproducibly underwent neoplastic transformation. In addition to inactivation of Dlc1 and increased activity of Rho and Cdc42, transformation depended on the subsequent decreased expression of the Cdk4/6 inhibitors p15(Ink4b) and p16(Ink4a) together with increased expression and activation of Cdk4/6. The level of expression of these cell-cycle regulatory genes was relevant to human tumors with low DLC1 expression. Analysis of publicly available annotated datasets of lung and colon cancer with gene expression microarray profiles indicated that, in pairwise comparisons, low DLC1 expression occurred frequently together (P < 0.01) with downregulation of p15(Ink4b) or p16(Ink4a) or upregulation of CDK4 or CDK6. In addition, an unfavorable prognosis (P < 0.05) was associated with low DLC1 and low p15(Ink4b) in lung cancer and colon cancer,  low DLC1 and low p16(Ink4a) in lung cancer, low DLC1 and high CDK4 in lung cancer, and low DLC1 and high CDK6 in colon cancer.

Moreover the 5years follow-up showed that patients discontinuing Celecoxib treatment had an increased incidence of adenomas as compared to the placebo arm. In the APC(min/+) mouse model short term treatment with Celecoxib reduced gut adenomas, but a prolonged administration of  the drug induced fibroblast activation and intestinal fibrosis with a final tumor burden. The way Celecoxib could directly activate human colon myofibroblasts (MF) has not yet been investigated. We found that MF are activated by non toxic doses  of Celecoxib. Celecoxib induces erk1-2 and Akt phosphorylation within 5'. This short term activation is apparently insufficient to cause phenotypic changes, but the contemporary triggering of EGFR causes an impressive synergic effect inducing MF proliferation and the neo-expression and release of Amphiregulin (AREG), a well known EGFR agonist involved in colon cancer progression. As a confirm to these observations, the erk inhibitor U0126 and the EGFR inhibitors Tyrphostin and Cetuximab were able to contrast AREG induction.

The pathologic and clinical characteristics of these patients were reviewed. Survival analysis was performed and prognostic factors were assessed. These data were compared with the results obtained from our 406 pure SCLC patients who presented during the same time period. RESULTS: The most common pathology was combined small-cell and large-cell with 16 cases followed by combined small- and squamous-cell carcinoma  (3 cases), 2 cases of small-cell and nonspecified NSCLC, and 1 case of small cell and adenocarcinoma. Overall survival was significantly higher in C-SCLC patients  compared with pure SCLC (median 15 vs. 10.8 months; P = .035). Surgery was significantly more common in this group of patients (45% vs. 3% in the pure small cell group; P < .0001). No difference in overall survival was observed in patients with C-SCLC and patients with pure SCLC, that did not receive surgery (P = .64).

In this study we analyzed records of patients being treated for cancer pain, 94 of whom were smokers and 392 of whom were nonsmokers, to determine smoking status group differences. Smokers had significantly higher pain intensity, fatigue, depression, and anxiety than nonsmokers (independent samples t-tests P < .002). Smokers were at higher risk for opioid misuse based on the short form of the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP). Specifically, smokers had more frequent problems with mood swings, taking medications other than how they are prescribed, a history of illegal drug use, and a history of legal problems (chi-square tests P </= .002). Changes in pain and opioid use were examined in a subset of patients (146 nonsmokers and 46 smokers) who were receiving opioid therapy on at least 2 of the 3 data time points (consult, follow-up 1 month after consult, follow-up 6 to 9 months after consult). Results  based on multilevel linear modeling showed that over a period of approximately 6  months, smokers continued to report significantly higher pain than nonsmokers. Both smokers and nonsmokers reported a significant decline in pain across the 6-month period; the rate of decline did not differ across smokers and nonsmokers. No significant difference over time was found in opioid use between smokers and nonsmokers. These findings will guide subsequent studies and inform clinical practice, particularly the relevancy of smoking cessation. PERSPECTIVE: This article describes pain, symptom burden, and risk for opioid misuse among cancer patients with pain across smoking status. Smoking appears to be a potential mechanism for having an increased pain and symptom burden and risk for opioid misuse. This improved understanding of cancer pain will inform clinical practice.',\n",

First, to identify genes involved in the susceptibility to NNK, we compared the lung transcriptomes of NNK-resistant C3H mice with that of the NNK-susceptible A/J mice, identifying differential expression of genes related to innate immunity and inflammation. Second, to identify gene expression induced by NNK, we compared the lung transcriptomes of C3H and A/J mice post-treatment. The Resistin-like alpha (Retnla) gene was highly upregulated in response to NNK only in susceptible mice. This gene product is known to recruit immune cells to the lung, and accumulation  of CD45 positive cells in A/J lungs correlated with increased Retnla expression.  Genetic susceptibility to NNK-induced lung tumourigenesis may relate in part to gene expression changes and alterations in the immune response to create a pro-tumourigenic environment, acting in concert with NNK's mutagenic effects.\",\n",

With the reference of several recent researches, positive clinical correlations have been identified with primary tumor xenografts models, but limitations in existed models reveals a need for improvement. Over the past decade, conceptual progress has been made that tumors  had increasingly been recognized as organs in which ostensibly normal cells as well as cancer cells participate actively in tumorigenesis by creating the \"tumor microenvironment\". Herein, we propose a hypothesis based on this novel conception that if transplanted as an organ, tumor implantation in nude mice would conserve  most approximated biological traits with improved success rate, which make personalized tumor xenograft model practical for pre-clinical trials as substitutes for each patient. In our pilot study, intact tumor bloc was applied in implantation to evaluate this notion. As a result, 107 xenografts from all 20  patients of gastric cancer were transplanted successfully. Pathological comparison confirmed that no differences between xenografts and primary tumors while the therapeutic response to two chemotherapeutic agents, docetaxel and pemetrexed, exhibited differently.

Conventional thoracoscopic surgery requires three or more port wounds for manipulations of endoscopic instruments. For complicated cancer surgery, more port wounds and a larger thoracotomy wound may be required due to technical reasons. We want to investigate the effectiveness of single-port thoracoscopic approach in elective thoracoscopic surgery for thoracic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 1st, 2010 to March 31, 2011, 90 consecutive patients underwent general thoracoscopic surgery performed by the same thoracic surgeon. Two patients with severe trauma and massive bleeding were excluded from the study. All patients included had thoracoscopic surgery with a single-port approach. The  surgical outcomes, complications, mortality and conversion rates were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients were included in this study. All these patients were operated on by the same surgeon. For sixty-eight patients, the single-port thoracoscopic approach was used. Nineteen patients were changed to a two-port thoracoscopic approach and one patient's was changed to mini-thoracotomy. Two patients died from terminal lung cancer and severe mitral regurgitation. Complications occurred in six cases. Eighty-seven patients (98.8%) were effectively managed with either single-port or a two-port approach. Only one patient was managed by mini-thoracotomy. CONCLUSION: Elective thoracoscopic surgery performed through a single-port wound is feasible. Single-incisional thoracoscopic surgery can be safely applied as a first-line approach in most cases of elective thoracoscopic procedures.\",\n",

In the present study, we examined whether parkin acts as a tumor suppressor in HeLa cells, a human cervical cancer cell line resistant to TNF-alpha-induced cell death. TNF-alpha-treatment alone did not affect HeLa cell viability. However, expression of parkin restored TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Increased cell death was due to the activation of the apoptotic pathway. Expression of parkin in TNF-alpha-treated HeLa cells stimulated cleavage of the pro-apoptotic proteins caspase-8, -9, -3, -7 and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). In addition, parkin  expression resulted in decreased expression of the caspase inhibitory protein, survivin. These results suggest that parkin acts as a tumor suppressor in human cervical cancer cells by modulating survivin expression and caspase activity. We  propose that this pathway is a novel molecular mechanism by which parkin functions as a tumor suppressor.',\n",

In this study, Fc-RGD and Fc-Am-RGD (Fc: ferrocenoyl; Am: 6-aminohexanoic acid) conjugates were synthesized, and the antitumor activities in vitro were investigated. The cell uptake of the conjugates by B16 murine melanoma cells was measured using HPLC-electrochemical method. The antitumor activities of the conjugates were also evaluated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometric measurements. The experimental results revealed that Fc-RGD and Fc-Am-RGD exhibit more effective antitumor activities than their parent compounds RGD and Fc-COOH. Moreover, it is found that Fc-Am-RGD yields the lowest IC(50) values of 5.2 +/- 1.4 muM toward B16 cells. The HPLC-electrochemical studies confirmed that the insertion of flexible alkyl spacer Am between Fc and RGD significantly increases the cell uptake toward B16 cells and consequently improves the antitumor activity.

Serum samples collected from HCCLM3-R metastatic HCC tumor model  at specific stages of metastasis (1 wk, 3 wks and 6 wks) were subjected to iTRAQ  labeling followed by 2DLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Twenty tumor-derived proteins were  identified through human specific peptides. Secretory clusterin (sCLU), which was significantly upregulated during cancer progression and metastasis, was chosen for further study. The expression of sCLU was significantly higher in metastatic  HCC cell lines and samples from metastatic HCC patients. ShRNA-mediated down-regulation of sCLU resulted in a reduced migratory capacity in HCC cell lines, as well as a reduction in pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Overexpression of  sCLU in HepG2 cell line showed increased cell migratory ability. Further study found that sCLU contributed to HCC migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, and metastasis in vivo. In addition, sCLU also plays an important role in the regulation of TGF-beta1-smad3 signaling. These findings  suggest that sCLU may promote HCC metastasis via the induction of EMT process and may be a candidate target for HCC therapy.',\n",

We have shown in vitro efficacy of FK228 in ovarian cancer. Here, our goal was to evaluate FK228 combined with cisplatin in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with cisplatin, FK228 or the combination of drugs. Colorimetric assays were used to determine cytotoxicity in vitro. Mice engrafted  with 5x10(6) SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells were treated with cisplatin, FK228 or the combination, and tumor weights and volumes were measured. We assessed molecular markers of proliferation (mib-1), apoptosis (cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3) and DNA damage (pH2AX, RAD51 and 53BP1). RESULTS: FK228 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in ovarian cells compared to vehicle-treated controls or each drug alone. The combination of FK228 and cisplatin-induced apoptosis and activated aberrant DNA damage responses demonstrated by increased expression of pH2AX, RAD51 and 53BP1. Mice treated with FK228, cisplatin and both drugs showed reduced tumor weights and volumes. Drug-treated tumors showed decreased mib-1 and increased cleaved-caspase 3 expression levels. The number and intensity of pH2AX stained cells was greatest in tumors exposed to the combination of FK228 and cisplatin. CONCLUSION: FK228 causes DNA damage-induced apoptosis and enhances the anti-tumor effects of cisplatin. The DNA damage mark pH2AX is activated by FK228 and cisplatin and may be a useful pharmacodynamic mark of these effects.',\n",

Androgen deprivation therapy-free survival (ADT-FS) defined as the time interval between the first day of SBRT and the initiation of ADT was the primary end point. ADT was initiated if more than 3 metastases were detected during follow-up even when patients were still asymptomatic or in case of a prostate specific antigen elevation above 50 ng/mL in the absence of metastases. Secondary end points were local control, clinical progression-free survival, and toxicity. Toxicity was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. RESULTS: We treated 24 patients with a median follow-up of 24 months. Ten patients started with ADT resulting in  a median ADT-FS of 38 months. The 2-year local control and clinical progression-free survival was 100% and 42%, respectively. Eleven and 3 patients,  respectively, required a second and third salvage treatment for metachronous low-volume metastatic disease. No grade 3 toxicity was observed.

Not surprisingly, human stem cells possess a highly efficient DNA repair network that becomes less efficient upon differentiation. Moreover, these cells also have an anaerobic metabolism, which reduces the mitochondria number and the likelihood of oxidative stress, which is highly related to genomic instability. If DNA lesions are not repaired, human stem cells easily undergo senescence, cell death or differentiation, as part of their DNA damage response, avoiding the propagation of stem cells carrying mutations and genomic alterations. Interestingly, cancer stem cells and typical stem cells share not only the differentiation potential but also their capacity to respond to DNA damage, with important implications for cancer therapy using genotoxic agents. On the other hand, the preservation of the adult stem cell pool, and the ability of cells to deal with DNA damage, is essential for normal development, reducing processes of neurodegeneration and premature aging, as one can observe on clinical phenotypes of many human genetic  diseases with defects in DNA repair processes. Finally, several recent findings suggest that DNA repair also plays a fundamental role in maintaining the pluripotency and differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells, as well as that of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. DNA repair processes also seem to be necessary for the reprogramming of human cells when iPS cells are produced. Thus, the understanding of how cultured pluripotent stem cells ensure the genetic stability are highly relevant for their safe therapeutic application, at the same time that cellular therapy is a hope for DNA repair deficient patients.',\n",

In  addition, in-depth analysis of disease course enabled the identification of possible predictive factors leading to some novel findings, such as the association between the decline in surgery risk and early treatment strategy. In  contrast, some unexplained differences exist, such as the low overall colectomy risk in ulcerative colitis.\",\n",

This meta-analysis was aimed at evaluating the risk of those serious adverse events associated with GLP-1 agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and clinicaltrials.gov were searched in order to identify longitudinal studies evaluating exenatide or liraglutide use and reporting data on AP or cancer. Odds  ratios (ORs) were pooled using a random-effects model. I(2) statistics assessed heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included. Neither exenatide (OR  0.84 [95% CI 0.58-1.22], I(2) = 30%) nor liraglutide (OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.21-4.39], I(2) = 0%) were associated with an increased risk of AP, independent of baseline  comparator. The pooled OR for cancer associated with exenatide was 0.86 (95% CI 0.29, 2.60, I(2) = 0%) and for liraglutide was 1.35 (95% CI 0.70, 2.59, I(2) = 0%). Liraglutide was not associated with an increased risk for thyroid cancer (OR 1.54 [95% CI 0.40-6.02], I(2) = 0%). For exenatide, no thyroid malignancies were  reported. CONCLUSIONS: Current available published evidence is insufficient to support an increased risk of AP or cancer associated with GLP-1 agonists.

Its limitation in clinical application for cancer therapy, however, arises from its strong anticoagulant activity, which causes associated adverse effects. In this study, we show the structural correlation of LHT7, a previously developed heparin-based angiogenesis inhibitor, with its influence on VEGF blockade and its decreased anticoagulant activity. LHT7 was characterized as having average seven  molecules of sodium taurocholates conjugated to one molecule of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). This study showed that the conjugation of sodium taurocholates selectively blocked interaction with antithrombin III (ATIII) while enhancing the binding with VEGF. This resulted in LHT7 to have negligible anticoagulant activity but potent anti-angiogenic activity. Following  up on this finding, we showed that the bidirectional effect of sodium taurocholate conjugation was due to its unique structure, that is, the sterane core hindering the ATIII-binding pentasaccharide unit of LMWH with its bulky and  rigid structural characteristics while the terminal sulfate group interacts with  VEGF to produce stronger binding. In addition, we showed that LHT7 was localized  in the tumor, especially on the endothelial cells. One explanation for this might be that LHT7 was delivered to the tumor via platelets.',\n",

However, clinical assessment by physical examination and different imaging modalities, as well as by histological examination of routine lymph node cryosections can miss micrometastases, while false positives may lead to unnecessary elective lymph node neck resections. Here, we explored the feasibility of developing a sensitive assay system for desmoglein 3 (DSG3) as a predictive biomarker for lymph node metastasis in HNSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DSG3 expression was determined in multiple general cancer- and HNSCC-tissue microarrays (TMAs), in negative and positive HNSCC metastatic cervical lymph nodes, and in a variety of HNSCC and control cell lines. A nanostructured immunoarray system was developed for the ultrasensitive detection  of DSG3 in lymph node tissue lysates. RESULTS: We demonstrate that DSG3 is highly expressed in all HNSCC lesions and their metastatic cervical lymph nodes, but absent in non-invaded lymph nodes. We show that DSG3 can be rapidly detected with high sensitivity using a simple microfluidic immunoarray platform, even in human  tissue sections including very few HNSCC invading cells, hence distinguishing between positive and negative lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: We provide a proof of principle supporting that ultrasensitive nanostructured assay systems for DSG3 can be exploited to detect micrometastatic HNSCC lesions in lymph nodes, which can improve the diagnosis and guide in the selection of appropriate therapeutic intervention modalities for HNSCC patients.',\n",

We present a novel method to compute a quantitative, normalized measure of tissue radiodensity traversed by the primary beam incident on each pixel of a mammogram, a measure we term the standard attenuation rate (SAR). SAR  enables: the estimation of breast density which is linked to cancer risk; direct  comparison between images; the full potential of computer aided diagnosis to be utilized; and a basis for digital breast tomosynthesis reconstruction. It does this by removing the effects of the imaging conditions under which the mammogram  is acquired. First, the x-ray spectrum incident upon the breast is calculated, and from this, the energy exiting the breast is calculated. The contribution of scattered radiation is calculated and subtracted. The SAR measure is the scaling  factor that must be applied to the reference material in order to match the primary attenuation of the breast. Specifically, this is the scaled reference material attenuation which when traversed by an identical beam to that traversing the breast, and when subsequently detected, results in the primary component of the pixel intensity observed in the breast image.

In this study, we analyzed the effect of preoperative immunonutrition and different  nutritional models on the clinical condition of colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: Twenty-eight colorectal cancer patients were grouped into 4 groups according to their nutrition regimens randomly and were given immunonutrition (IMN), standard enteral (SE), total parental nutrition (TPN), and normal nutrition (NN) regimens, all of which contained the same calorie-nitrogen content within a 7-day preoperative period. All patients had an endoscopic biopsy before  and after the regimen, and the lymphocyte population infiltrating mucosal parts of the resected tumor tissue were evaluated. Immunohistochemical analysis of the  tissue specimens was performed by staining with antihuman CD4(+), CD8(+), CD16(+), and CD56(+) antibodies. RESULTS: After nutrition, there were significant increases in each of the 4 groups of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells within the tumor. Comparing the rates of augmentation, the increased rates of the CD8(+) cells infiltrating the tumor after nutrition in the patients who were fed with IMN were significantly more than the ones in other groups (P = .01). CD16(+) cell infiltration was significantly higher in all groups except the SE and IMN groups. The SE group had increased CD56(+) cell infiltration compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the colorectal cancer patients who had nutrition in the 7-day preoperative period, except for the SE nutrition group, there were significant increases of infiltration of CD56(+) cells at the mucosal part of the tumor tissue within the CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell population.

DNA methylation is  a common event in CRC where it is now considered an important phenomenon in CRC carcinogenesis and useful for the classification and prognosis of CRC. METHODS: To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning CRC in Saudi Arabian patients, we profiled the DNA methylation frequency of key genes (MLH1, MSH2, RASSF1A, SLIT2, HIC1, MGMT, SFRP1, MYOD1, APC, CDKN2A, as well as five CIMP markers) in 120 sporadic CRC cases. CRC tumors originating from the rectum, left, and right colons are represented in this cohort of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. RESULTS: The most common methylation frequency was detected in the polycomb group target genes (PCGT) including SFRP1 (70%), MYOD1 (60.8%), HIC1 (61.7%), and SLIT2 (56.7%). In addition, MGMT methylation was detected at a high frequency (68.3%). RASSF1A, APC, and CDKN2A methylation frequencies were 42.5%, 25%, and 32.8%, respectively. K-means clustering analysis of the methylation events results in the clustering of the CRC samples into three groups depending on the level of methylation detected. CONCLUSION: Group II (PCGT methylation and CIMP-negative) methylation signature carried a favorable prognosis for male patients, whereas older patients with group I rare methylation signature have a potentially poorer clinical outcome.

Gastric juice was collected by gastro-endoscopic examination, and the bile acid concentration was examined by enzymatic method. The grade of histologic gastritis was evaluated by gastric biopsies, and the relationship between the bile acid concentration and the gastritis score was examined. The occurrence of gastric cancer was examined by a retrospective cohort study. CDX2/CINC1 expression in RGM-1 cells was evaluated by real-time PCR. RESULTS: In H. pylori-positive patients, we found significant positive correlation between the bile acid concentration and the grades of atrophy/intestinal metaplasia (P < 0.01). However, we found significant negative associations between the bile acid concentrations and the histologic scores of mononuclear cell/neutrophil infiltrations (P < 0.01). Patients with a high concentration of bile acid developed gastric cancer more frequently than those with a low concentration (P < 0.05).

New data are presented on the role of H. pylori in neurodegenerative disorders and in the metabolic syndrome. H. pylori is associated with a (small) increase in the risk for colorectal adenoma and colon cancer. The biggest challenge is the selection of new therapies and treatment strategies because of the increasing failure of standard triple therapies. The best option in high clarithromycin resistance areas is bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Probiotic bacteria and yeasts reduce adverse effects of standard H. pylori eradication regimens. In gastric cancer prevention, screening programs based on the serological detection of preneoplastic conditions may prove useful.

In the cancer setting, most studies suggest the use of both clinical  and intraoperative biopsy criteria in patient selection. This study examines the  use of both biopsy and clinical criteria in women undergoing total nipple-removing mastectomy. METHODS: The study consisted of 58 patients undergoing total mastectomy without nipple sparing. Biopsies of the subareola tissue (SA), proximal nipple (NC) contents and radial sections of the residual nipple (NR) were examined microscopically. Tumor size and distance from the nipple were also noted. RESULTS: Using clinical criteria alone, the false negative rate was 53.8% and a false positive rate of 44.4%. When adding subareola and nipple core biopsies to clinical criteria the false negative rate fell to 7.7% but the false positive rate remained at 44.4%. When using only SA and NC biopsies to predict occult nipple involvement, the false negative rate was 11.8%. In 4 cases the NC was positive while the SA was negative for cancer and in 6 cases the SA was positive and NC negative. In 2 cases both the NC and SA biopsies were negative while the NR was positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a more  limited role in the use of clinical criteria for evaluating patients for NSM. This maximizes the number of patients who are candidates for NSM with minimal risk of nipple involvement. It was also noted that intraoperative biopsies are not totally reliable in predicting occult nipple involvement.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of prophylactic central compartment neck dissection (CCND) on serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels and recommendations for adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI). METHODS: The records of 103 patients who underwent completion/total thyroidectomy for DTC  between January 2009 and November 2010 were reviewed. Prophylactic CCND was defined as removal of central compartment lymph nodes with no preoperative or intraoperative evidence of lymphadenopathy. Institutional protocol included a diagnostic whole-body scan before RAI; patients with a negative scan and Tg < 2.0 did not receive adjuvant RAI. RESULTS: Among the 103 patients, therapeutic CCND was performed in 17 (17 %) and prophylactic CCND in 49 (48 %). Of the 49 patients, 20 (41 %) had positive cervical lymph nodes. Positive lymph nodes changed American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor, node, metastasis staging in 17  patients and recommendations for RAI in 14. At a median follow-up of 21 months, there was no difference in Tg level based on the application of CCND; however, 92 % of patients with M0 disease had an undetectable Tg. One patient had recurrent DTC based on serum Tg only. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic CCND resulted in detection  of unsuspected metastatic lymphadenopathy in 20 (41 %) of 49 patients and changed RAI recommendations in 14 (33 %). To date, most patients have an undetectable Tg. Longer follow-up is needed to detect potential differences in recurrent disease based on the use of CCND or long-term effects of RAI.',\n",

This study compares patients managed by  hepatobiliary centers from diagnosis with those referred for liver resection (LR). METHODS: Between 1998 and 2010, a total of 284 patients with SCRLM underwent resection; 106 resectable patients (1-3 unilobar metastases, diameter <100 mm, liver-only disease) were divided into two groups: 66 managed from diagnosis (group A) and 40 referred for LR (group B). RESULTS: Group A contained  a greater proportion of multiple metastases (55.0 vs. 34.8%, P = 0.042). Group B  always received colorectal surgery as up-front treatment (vs. 18.2%, P < 0.0001). In group B, chemotherapy before LR was more common (72.5 vs. 33.3%, P = 0.0001) and lasted longer (P = 0.010). More patients in group B exhibited disease progression before LR (17.5 vs. 3.0%, P = 0.025). Group A underwent fewer surgical procedures (80.3% simultaneous resection vs. 0%, P < 0.00001), with similar short-term outcomes. After a median follow-up of 42.0 months, group A exhibited higher 5 year disease-free survival (DFS, 64.8 vs. 30.8%, P = 0.005) and fewer extrahepatic recurrences (21.5 vs. 47.5%, P = 0.005). The late-referral group (>6 months, n = 24) had shorter median overall survival (OS) and DFS than group A (49.1 and 25.3 months vs. not achieved and not achieved, P < 0.05). The early-referral group exhibited OS and DFS similar to group A. Multivariate analysis confirmed late referral as a negative predictive factor of OS and DFS.

We determined whether application of Z0011 guidelines would reduce costs. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with invasive breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and  SLNB at our institution during 2009 was performed. We determined the number of overnight hospital admissions following ALND and estimated costs pertaining to the perioperative surgical management of the axilla patients actually received, and compared those to the estimated number of inpatient days and perioperative costs if Z0011 guidelines had been followed for eligible patients. The 2011 Medicare Fee Schedule was used to estimate costs for procedures, and costs for OR time were estimated using procedure length and cost of OR time per minute. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients underwent lumpectomy with SLNB and had at least 1 positive SLN. Estimated costs related to perioperative surgical management of the axilla were $322,775, and there were 36 overnight admissions. Applying Z0011 criteria, 51 patients (72%) would have been eligible to forego completion ALND. Estimated costs would have been $264,513 with 13 overnight admissions, translating into a cost savings of $58,262 and 23 fewer overnight admissions.

While CD4 and CD8 T cells have been correlated with outcome following CRCLM resection, the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) is not well defined. METHODS: TIL in 188 patients who underwent CRCLM resection between 1998 and 2000 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. Correlation between TIL composition and outcome was determined while controlling for established prognostic factors. Total T cells (CD3), helper T cells (CD4), cytotoxic T cells  (CD8), and Treg (FoxP3) were analyzed. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 40 months for all patients and 95 months for survivors. Overall survival (OS) at 5 and 10 years was 40 and 25%, respectively. The CD4 T cell count correlated with OS (p = .02) and recurrence-free survival (p = .04). A high number of CD8 T cells relative to total T cells (CD8:CD3 ratio) predicted longer OS times (p = .05). Analysis of Treg revealed that high FoxP3:CD4 (p = .03) and FoxP3:CD8 (p = .05) ratios were independent predictors of shorter OS. Patients with a high clinical risk score (CRS) were more likely to have a high number of intratumoral Treg, and patients >/=65 years old had a less robust CRCLM T cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: A high number of Treg relative to CD4 or CD8 T cells predicted poor  outcome, suggesting an immunosuppressive role for FoxP3 + TIL.

Tumor downstaging after RCT  for rectal cancer can be obtained in half of cases, whereas a complete pathological response (CPR) is reported to range between 15 and 30%. It is not possible to foresee before therapies who will respond. METHODS: Patients with stage II-III rectal cancer that had undergone RCT and rectal resection between January 1995 and October 2010 were considered. Patients were divided in those who achieved a CPR, \"CR\" group, and those who did not achieve a CPR, \"NCR\" group. Univariate and multivariate analyses between groups were performed considering the clinical parameters: gender, age, ASA score, preoperative hematic CEA, tumor  grading; distance of the tumor from the anal verge, maximum tumor diameter, TNM stage, and neoadjuvant treatment details. RESULTS: Among 260 patients, 43 (16.5%) achieved a CPR. The two groups resulted homogeneous for age, sex, pretreatment status, and tumor stage. A CEA <5 ng/dl and distance from anal verge >5 cm were correlated with CPR at multivariate analysis. Patients with both these conditions presented a significantly higher CPR rate (30.6%) as well as improved 5-year survival. CPR was also correlated with improved survival.

N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is a differentiation-related gene that is considered to be a metastasis suppressor gene. In this study, we examined the expression and DNA methylation of NDRG2 in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues, as well as its clinical significance. METHODS: Six gastric cancer cell lines and 42 paired normal and gastric cancer tissue samples were used to assess NDRG2 mRNA expression using RT-PCR. NDRG2 DNA methylation status was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues. The suppression of NDRG2 in BGC823 cells by siRNA transfection was utilized to detect the role of NDRG2 in gastric cancer progression. RESULTS: NDRG2 mRNA was down-regulated in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues, and its expression was just related to lymph node metastasis (p = 0.032). MSP showed methylation of NDRG2 in 54.0 % (47/87) of primary gastric cancer specimens and in 20.0 % (16/80) of corresponding nonmalignant gastric tissues. NDRG2 methylation was related to depth of tumor invasion, Borrmann classification and TNM stage (p  < 0.05). Upon treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, NDRG2 expression was upregulated in HGC27 cells, and demethylation of the highly metastatic cell line, MKN45, inhibited cell invasion. Furthermore, the suppression of NDRG2 by siRNA transfection enhanced BGC823 cells invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the aberrant methylation of NDRG2 may be mainly responsible for its downregulation in gastric cancer, and may play an important role in the metastasis of gastric cancer.\",\n",

This registration of radiation dose to endoscopic or optical imaging may be valuable in assessment of normal tissue response to radiation, and visualization of radiated tissues in patients receiving post-radiation surgery. Electromagnetic sensors embedded in a flexible endoscope were used to track the position and orientation of the endoscope allowing registration of 2D endoscopic images to CT  volumetric images and radiation doses planned with respect to these images. A surface was rendered from the CT image based on the air/tissue threshold, creating a virtual endoscopic view analogous to the real endoscopic view. Radiation dose at the surface or at known depth below the surface was assigned to each segment of the virtual surface. Dose could be displayed as either a colorwash on this surface or surface isodose lines. By assigning transparency levels to each surface segment based on dose or isoline location, the virtual dose display was overlaid onto the real endoscope image. Spatial accuracy of the  dose display was tested using a cylindrical phantom with a treatment plan created for the phantom that matched dose levels with grid lines on the phantom surface.  The accuracy of the dose display in these phantoms was 0.8-0.99 mm. To demonstrate clinical feasibility of this approach, the dose display was also tested on clinical data of a patient with laryngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy, with estimated display accuracy of approximately 2-3 mm. The utility of  the dose display for registration of radiation dose information to the surgical field was further demonstrated in a mock sarcoma case using a leg phantom. With direct overlay of radiation dose on endoscopic imaging, tissue toxicities and tumor response in endoluminal organs can be directly correlated with the actual tissue dose, offering a more nuanced assessment of normal tissue toxicities following radiation therapy and accurate registration of radiation dose to the surgical field.',\n",

To determine the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan and cisplatin with concurrent split-course thoracic radiotherapy in limited-disease (LD) SCLC, we conducted a phase II study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients fulfilling the following eligibility criteria were enrolled: chemotherapy-naive, good performance status (PS 0-1), age </=75, LD-SCLC, and adequate organ function. The patients received irinotecan 40  mg/m(2) i.v. on days 1, 8, and 15, and cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) i.v. on day 1. Four cycles of chemotherapy were repeated every 4 weeks. Split-course thoracic radiotherapy of once-daily 2 Gy/day commenced on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle, with 26 and 24 Gy administered in the first and second cycles, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were eligible and assessable for response, toxicity, and survival. Patients' characteristics were as follows: male/female = 29/5; PS 0/1 = 18/16; median age (range) = 67 (50-73); and stage IB/IIA/IIB/IIIA/IIIB = 2/2/3/16/11. The overall response was 100 % (CR 8, PR 26). Grade 4 leukopenia, neutropenia, grade 3-5 pneumonitis, diarrhea, and esophagitis occurred in 24, 38, 6, 3, and 0 %, respectively. There were 2 treatment-related deaths from pneumonitis. The median time to tumor progression was 14.3 months. The median overall survival time and the 2- and 5-year survival rates were 44.5 months, 66.7 and 46.1 %, respectively. No tumor progression was observed in patients with CR.

However, NLRP3-deficient mice displayed a similar incidence of malignant mesothelioma and survival times as wild-type mice. Thus, early inflammatory reactions triggered by asbestos are NLRP3-dependent, but NLRP3 is not critical in the chronic development of asbestos-induced mesothelioma.

Nearly 90 to 95 % of all HCC occur in the context of known and often preventable risk factors, such as chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and metabolic disorders. Although several experimental lines of research support a direct role for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in cancer promotion, cirrhosis is the main risk factor for this tumor, whereas other factors like alcohol and tobacco smoking are clearly able to accelerate HCC development. For this reason, cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV infection are subjected to abdominal ultrasound surveillance every 6 months, aimed at an early diagnosis of  HCC to allow curative treatment options. Current strategies to positively impact  on HCC incidence rates in HCV patients include prevention of cirrhosis development by avoiding metabolic, pharmacological, or social factors associated  with accelerated progression of liver disease, or through virus eradication by interferon-based treatments. Moreover, a successful antiviral treatment has the added benefit of positively impacting on the rate of HCC development also in patients who are already cirrhotic.',\n",

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer mortality and its rates have recently been increasing in central and northern Europe and USA.

We conducted a MEDLINE search for observational studies reporting the association between exposure to statins and risk for incident liver cancer until March 2012. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were used to estimate summary relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Moreover, between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using adequate statistical tests. Five observational studies (two case-control and three cohort studies) based on 2574 cases of HCC were included. Statin treatment, compared with no treatment, was inversely related to HCC (summary RR=0.58; 95% CI 0.46-0.74). Between-study heterogeneity was significant (P<0.001) and numerically relevant (I=65%). When only longest statin use was considered, the RR was 0.66 (95% CI 0.55-0.80). Influence analysis on the overall estimate showed that heterogeneity was largely  because of one study; when omitting it, the I dropped to 27% (P=0.240), whereas the summary RR was only marginally modified (RR=0.52; 95% CI 0.44-0.62).

During follow-up, 456 new cancers were identified. No significant association was found between lipoprotein(a) and the all-site or main-site-specific cancers (hazard ratios for  quartiles 2-4 vs. 1, respectively: 1.24, 1.11, 1.29, P=0.23).

METHODS: The design and conduct of this qualitative study was guided by Charmaz\\' social constructivist grounded theory. To collect data, focus groups and telephone interviews were conducted. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and imported into NVivo8 to organize data and codes. Data were analyzed using key grounded theory principles of constant comparison, data saturation, and initial, focused, and theoretical coding. RESULTS: Participants were 3 men and 26 women who had developed upper- or lower-limb lymphoedema following cancer treatment. Three conceptual categories were developed during data analysis and were labeled \"accidental journey,\" \"altered normalcy,\" and \"ebb and flow of control.\" \"Altered normalcy\" reflects the physical and psychosocial consequences of lymphoedema and its relationship to everyday life. \"Accidental journey\" explains the participants\\' experiences with the health care system, including the prevention, treatment, and management of their lymphoedema. \"Ebb and flow of control\" draws upon a range of individual and social elements that influenced the participants\\' perceived control over lymphoedema. These conceptual categories were interrelated and contributed to the core category of \"sense of self,\" which describes their perceptions of their identity and roles.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with HCC who received TACE were asked to rate their symptoms using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory and the symptom checklist particularly for HCC. To determine the interrelationships among symptoms and identify the symptom clusters, a principal component analysis with varimax rotation was carried out on the symptom items. Spearman correlation analysis was done to assess the relationship between symptom clusters and symptom interference. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients finished the whole procedure between November 2010 and May 2011. Before TACE, the five most severe symptoms, ranked in order, were fatigue (3.40 +/- 2.26), distress (3.35 +/- 2.60), sadness (3.01 +/- 2.66),  sleep disturbance (2.63 +/- 2.57), and lack of appetite (2.26 +/- 2.38). After TACE, fatigue (4.88 +/- 2.31) was the most serious symptom, followed by sleep disturbance (4.80 +/- 2.25), distress (4.59 +/- 2.32), sadness (4.45 +/- 2.16), lack of appetite (4.25 +/- 2.51). Two symptom clusters were found before TACE: psychological symptom cluster and sickness symptom cluster. Two new symptom clusters were found after TACE: upper gastrointestinal symptom cluster and liver  function impairment symptom cluster, with the two original symptom clusters remained relatively stable. The highest symptom interference items pre- and post-TACE were work and enjoyment of life, followed by mood. The symptoms of distress, sadness, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and lack of appetite were all significantly associated with the total interference (r = 0.443-0.615, p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). Symptom clusters were significantly correlated with the total symptom interference before and after TACE (r = 0.176-0.638, p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Psychological symptom cluster and sickness symptom cluster are common for HCC patients before and after TACE. Liver function impairment and upper gastrointestinal symptom clusters are directly related to TACE treatment. Both the symptoms and symptom clusters have significant interference on the daily life of HCC patients undergoing TACE. However, more work is needed to further clarify the symptom clusters associated with TACE and to test the effectiveness of TACE in easing symptoms and improving quality of life of HCC patients.',\n",

It is not well known how to enterally feed mucositis patients, potentially experiencing malabsorption. Recently, we showed in a rat model of methotrexate (MTX)-induced mucositis that intestinal absorption of glucose in trace amounts is still intact. We now determined the quantitative capacity to absorb glucose in rats with mucositis, relative to controls. METHODS: We administered a physiologically relevant amount of [1-(13)C]glucose-enriched glucose (meal size) as a bolus by oral gavage (2 g/kg once) or continuously by intraduodenal infusion (+/-1.9 g/(kg.h) for 5 h) to rats with MTX-induced mucositis and controls. Blood [1-(13)C]glucose concentrations were determined during the experimental period. To calculate the quantitative absorptive capacity, Steele's one-compartment model, including simultaneous intravenous infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose, was used. After the experiment, jejunal histology and plasma citrulline concentrations were assessed. RESULTS: MTX-induced mucositis was confirmed by a reduction in villus length and plasma citrulline (both -57%, relative to controls, P < 0.01). When glucose was administered as a bolus, MTX-treated rats only absorbed 15% of administered glucose, compared with 85% in controls (medians, P < 0.01). Upon continuous intraduodenal glucose infusion, the median absorptive capacity for glucose in MTX-treated rats did not differ from controls (80 versus 93% of administered glucose respectively, P = 0.06). However, glucose absorption differed substantially between individual MTX-treated rats (range, 21-95%), which correlated poorly with villus length (rho = 0.54, P = 0.030) and plasma citrulline (rho = 0.56, P = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Continuous enteral administration can almost completely overcome the reduced absorptive capacity for glucose in rats with mucositis.\",\n",

In this study, by simply  mixing G5.NH(2)-DTA dendrimers with gold salt in aqueous solution at room temperature, dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DENPs) with a mean core size of 2.5 nm were able to be spontaneously formed. Followed by an acetylation reaction to neutralize the dendrimer remaining terminal amines, Au DSNPs with a mean size of 6 nm were formed. The formed DTA-containing [(Au(0))(50)-G5.NHAc-DTA] DSNPs were characterized via different techniques. We show that the Au DSNPs are colloid stable in aqueous solution under different pH  and temperature conditions. In vitro hemolytic assay, cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry analysis, and cell morphology observation reveal that the formed Au DSNPs have good hemocompatibility and are non-cytotoxic at a concentration up to  3.0 muM. X-ray absorption coefficient measurements show that the DTA-containing Au DSNPs have enhanced attenuation intensity, much higher than that of [(Au(0))(50)-G5.NHAc] DENPs without DTA or Omnipaque at the same molar concentration of the active element (Au or iodine).

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine reliable prognostic biomarkers by the analysis of patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from the CRLM tissues  of a cohort of 126 patients with CRLM with curative hepatic resection. The KRAS/BRAF mutation spectrum and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were successfully analyzed in 100 of the 126 CRLM tissues and these findings were examined in relation to the patients' clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The cohort of 100 CRLM patients consisted of 46 with synchronous and 54 with metachronous liver metastasis. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 years were 57.4 and 24.9 %, respectively. MSI analysis revealed that none of the 100 CRLM specimens showed any evidence of MSI. By KRAS/BRAF mutation analysis, the analyzed CRLM patients were divided into 3 groups; KRAS-mutant (KRAS-Mt; n = 27), BRAF-mutant (BRAF-Mt; n = 3), and wild-types of both genes (Wild-type; n = 70). In the survival analysis, both KRAS-Mt and BRAF-Mt patients showed significantly poorer  prognoses compared with Wild-type patients. Furthermore, although the population  with the BRAF mutation was small, this mutation had a significant negative impact on disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, all tumors in the cohort of CRLM patients were non-MSI tumors, suggesting MSI cancer in primary CRC would rarely reveal metastatic potential.

It has a unique capability of fully regenerating after injury.

METHODS: This review describes the characteristics of hepatic stem/progenitor cells and the regulatory mechanism of their self-renewal and differentiation capacity. RESULTS: In liver organogenesis, undifferentiated hepatic stem/progenitor cells expand their pool by repeated self-renewal in the early stage of liver development and then differentiate into two different types of cell lineage, namely hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Liver development is regulated by expression of stem cell transcription factors in a complex multistep process. Recent studies suggest that stem cells are maintained by integrative regulation of gene expression patterns related to self-renewal and differentiation by epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modification and DNA methylation.

It is caused by mutations in the ATM kinase, which functions in the DNA-damage response and redox sensing. In addition to severe cerebellar degeneration, A-T pathology includes cancer predisposition, sterility, immune system dysfunction, and bone marrow abnormalities. These latter phenotypes are recapitulated in the ATM null (ATM(-/-)) mouse model of the disease. Since oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are implicated in A-T, we determined whether reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) via overexpression of catalase targeted to mitochondria (mCAT) alleviates A-T-related pathology in ATM(-/-) mice. We found that mCAT has many beneficial effects in this context, including reduced propensity to develop thymic lymphoma, improved bone marrow hematopoiesis and macrophage differentiation in vitro, and partial rescue of memory T-cell developmental defects. Our results suggest that positive effects observed on cancer development may be linked to mCAT reducing mitochondrial ROS, lactate production, and TORC1 signaling in transforming double-positive cells, whereas beneficial effects in memory T cells appear to be TORC1-independent. Altogether,  this study provides proof-of-principle that reducing mitochondrial ROS production per se may be therapeutic for the disease, which may have advantages compared with more general antioxidant strategies.',\n",

An unidentified genetic defect is believed to play a role in this condition. The risk of SP and/or CRC for first-degree relatives (FDRs) is not yet well known. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of both SP and/or CRC by studying the FDRs of our index SP cases and to propose an appropriate interval for colonoscopy surveillance in this group. METHODS: From 2005 to December 2011, we prospectively included all patients from our hospital who fulfilled the SP diagnostic criteria. We interviewed FDRs face to face and offered a colonoscopy to those who were 35 years old or older. The study was carried out with conventional and high-definition colonoscopes and chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine at the discretion of a single endoscopist. The samples were assessed by two pathologists. We reviewed the clinical data for  CRC diagnosed previously in FDRs. RESULTS: From 2005, we collected all the new cases of SP and offered a colonoscopy to 95 FDRs of 34 pedigrees. We performed colonoscopies on 78 FDRs (82.1%). The incidence of SP in the FDRs was 32% (25 patients). Seventy-six percent of patients were diagnosed with SP as they had any number of serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon. Only one patient was diagnosed with CRC as a result of the screening colonoscopy. 44.1% of our index cases had an FDR with a diagnosis of CRC. CONCLUSION: Our series, which is the largest prospective cohort of FDRs published, reports an elevated incidence of SP in FDRs, thus supporting the need for screening colonoscopy in FDR and its inclusion in the guidelines.',\n",

However, they are not well studied. AIMS: We used a mixed quantitative-qualitative approach to  analyze postreferral colonoscopy delays in CRC patients and explored referring physician's perception of processes surrounding these delays. METHODS: Two physician-raters conducted independent electronic health record reviews of new CRC cases in a large integrated safety-net system to determine postreferral colonoscopy delays, which we defined as failures to perform colonoscopy within 60 days of referral for an established indication(s). To explore perceptions of colonoscopy processes, we conducted semistructured interviews with a sample of primary care physicians (PCPs) and used a content analysis approach. RESULTS: Of  104 CRC cases that met inclusion criteria, reviewers agreed on the presence of postreferral colonoscopy delays in 35 (33.7%) cases; kappa = 0.99 (95% CI, 0.83-0.99). The median time between first referral and completion of colonoscopy  was 123.0 days (range 62.0-938.0; interquartile range = 90.0 days). In about two-thirds of instances (64.8%), the reason for delay was a delayed future appointment with the gastroenterology service. On interviews, PCPs attributed long delays in scheduling to reduced endoscopic capacity and inefficient processes related to colonoscopy referral and scheduling, including considerable  ambiguity regarding referral guidelines. Many suggested that navigation models be applied to streamline CRC diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Postreferral delays in CRC diagnosis are potentially preventable. A comprehensive mixed-methods methodology  might be useful for others to identify the steps in the diagnostic process that are in most need for improvement.\",\n",

As the development of brain metastases is fatal, controlling its progression is clinically meaningful. However, effective therapy for MBC patients with brain metastasis after cranial radiation is limited. The international clinical study in which six Japanese patients participated indicated the antitumor activity of lapatinib against brain metastases of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. METHODS: The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of lapatinib 750 mg given twice daily to Japanese HER2-overexpressing MBC patients with brain metastases were assessed as part of the international clinical study. RESULTS: Of six Japanese patients treated in this study, two patients had shown volumetric reduction >20 % in their central nervous system (CNS), one of whom had >50 % reduction. Three patients, including  two of these patients, had shown >20 % volumetric reduction in non-CNS lesions. Frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea and rash, all of which were controllable.

However, optimal dosing schedule, including drug selection, number of cycles, and interval between chemotherapy and cystectomy, as well as acceptable regimens remain to be established. We conducted a single-arm prospective study to evaluate efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus carboplatin (GCarbo) chemotherapy followed by immediate RC in patients with muscle-invasive BC, including cisplatin-unfit patients. METHODS: Between March 2005 and June 2011, we enrolled 116 patients with histologically proven muscle-invasive BC, including 44 % of the patients who were identified as cisplatin-unfit. All participants received two courses of GCarbo therapy, gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) administered on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin with an area under the curve of four (AUC 4) administered on day 2. RC and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed approximately within a month after cessation of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was pT0 in the cystectomy specimen. Secondary endpoints were overall response rate, overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity. Survival after cystectomy was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The RC specimens of 28 (24.1 %) patients  showed pT0. At a median follow-up period of 41 months, the OS and DFS rates were  89.7 and 86.3 %, respectively.

Here we report that SWNTs can inhibit telomerase activity through stabilization of i-motif structure. The persistence of i-motif and the concomitant G-quadruplex eventually leads to telomere uncapping and displaces telomere-binding proteins from telomere. The dysfunctional telomere triggers DNA damage response and elicits upregulation of p16 and p21 proteins. This is the first example that SWNTs can inhibit telomerase activity and interfere with the telomere functions in cancer cells.

Overall survival was similar for both approaches whilst the length of stay was decreased in simultaneous resections. Only two studies comparing the 'reverse' versus staged or simultaneous resections were found. The studies investigating resection versus non-resection for rectal primaries with unresectable liver metastases were limited. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous resections are a reasonable alternative to staged resections for either advanced rectal cancers with limited liver disease or early rectal cancers with extensive liver disease. Currently, staged resections are favoured over simultaneous resections in patients with locally advanced rectal cancers with extensive liver disease. There are too few studies to determine the safety of reverse resections in the context of locally advanced  rectal cancers. A resection of the primary tumour or a non-surgical intervention  can be justified in the management of the rectal cancer primary in the presence of unresectable liver metastases.\",\n",

The identification and characterization of new targets for LBH589 action would further enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in HDACi therapy. The role of the tumor suppressor  death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) in LBH589-induced cytotoxicity has not been investigated to date. Stable DAPK knockdown (shRNA) and DAPK overexpressing  (DAPK+++) cell lines were generated from HCT116 wildtype colon cancer cells. LBH589 inhibited cell proliferation, reduced the long-term survival, and up-regulated and activated DAPK in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, LBH589 significantly suppressed the growth of colon tumor xenografts and in accordance with the in vitro studies, increased DAPK levels were detected immunohistochemically. LBH589 induced a DAPK-dependent autophagy as assessed by punctuate accumulation of LC3-II, the formation of acidic vesicular organelles, and degradation of p62 protein. LBH589-induced autophagy seems to be predominantly caused by DAPK protein interactions than by its kinase activity. Caspase inhibitor zVAD increased autophagosome formation, decreased the cleavage  of caspase 3 and PARP but didn't rescue the cells from LBH589-induced cell death  in crystal violet staining suggesting both caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent apoptosis pathways. Pre-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 caused caspase 3-mediated apoptosis in a DAPK-dependent  manner. Altogether our data suggest that DAPK induces autophagy in response to HDACi-treatment. In autophagy deficient cells, DAPK plays an essential role in committing cells to HDACi-induced apoptosis.\",\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients underwent multiparametric MR imaging  (MRI) on a 3 T system using a phased array body coil and spine coil elements for  signal detection before prostatectomy. The examination included T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE-MRI), and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Histopathology slides were correlated to T2W images and a stringent matching procedure was performed to define cancer and noncancer areas of the peripheral zone without influence of the MR image appearance. Mean T2W signal intensity, apparent diffusion coefficient, area under the enhancement curve, and choline + creatine-to-citrate signal ratio  were calculated for cancer and noncancer areas. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed on MR-derived parameters from the selected areas. Logistic regression was used to create models based on best combination of parameters. A simplified approach assigning a parametric score to each segment based on cutoff values from ROC analysis was also explored. RESULTS: By using the stringent matching procedure, 138 noncancer and 41 cancer segments were selected  in the T2W images and transferred to the images of the other MR methods. A significant difference between mean values in cancer and noncancer segments was observed for all MR parameters analyzed (P < 0.001). Apparent diffusion coefficient was the best performing single parameter, with an area under the ROC  curve Az,DWI of 0.90 for prostate cancer detection. Any combination of T2WI, DWI, and DCE-MRI was significantly better than T2WI alone in separating cancer from noncancer segments (Az,T2WI + DWI + DCE-MRI = 0.94, Az,T2WI + DWI = 0.92, Az,T2WI + DCE-MRI = 0.91, Az,T2WI = 0.85). The combination of T2WI and MRSI was also better than T2WI alone (Az, T2WI + MRSI = 0.90); however, the logistic regression models including MRSI did not have significant parameters. The simplified approach combining all parameters gave similar results to logistic regression combining all parameters (Az = 0.95 and 0.97, respectively). CONCLUSION: By selecting histopathology defined cancer and noncancer areas without influence of  image contrast, this study objectively reveals that all investigated MR parameters have the ability to separate cancer from noncancer areas in the peripheral zone individually and that any combination is better than T2WI alone.',\n",

The highest rate is in Eastern Asia, mainly in Japan and China. In Brazil, gastric cancer is the third most common cancer in males and the fifth most common cancer in females. Rio Grande do Sul state, in Southern Brazil, has similar figures. The main histological type of gastric cancer is adenocarcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the trends of this cancer  over 25 years in a reference center in central Rio Grande do Sul. METHODS: We reviewed the records of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies performed at the University Hospital of Santa Maria, RS, between 1986 and 2010. We evaluated the incidence, age and gender distribution, anatomical subsite and histological subtype of gastric cancer throughout this 25-year period. RESULTS: We identified  histologically confirmed primary gastric adenocarcinoma in 335 (1.6%) of the 20,521 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy during the study period. The mean age of patients was 62.4 (+/- 13.0) years, and 67.8% were male (a male: female ratio of 2.0:1). Cardia cancer accounted for 14.3% of the cases,  and non-cardia cancer accounted for 85.7%. According to Lauren's classification,  48.1% were intestinal subtype and 40.9% were diffuse subtype. There were no differences in mean age or gender distribution by anatomical location or histological subtype. There was also no difference in the proportions of histological subtypes by anatomical location. Over the 25-year period, there was  no change in the anatomical distribution of tumors, but there was a significant decrease in the intestinal subtype and a steady increase in the diffuse subtype (P = 0.02). The subset of 39 patients (11.6%) who presented at < 45 years of age  was more likely to be female and to have tumors of the diffuse subtype than was the total series of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Over this 25-year period, there were no significant trends in age, gender distribution, or the proportions of cardia and non-cardia gastric adenocarcinomas in this series of patients from Southern Brazil. There was a significant decrease in the intestinal subtype and a steady increase in the diffuse subtype of this malignancy. In patients under 45 years old, gastric cancer was more frequent in women, and the diffuse subtype predominated.\",\n",

Most patients with advanced esophageal cancer have significant dysphagia that contributes to weight loss and malnutrition. Esophageal stenting is a widespread palliation approach, but unsuitable for cancers near the upper esophageal sphincter, were stents are poorly tolerated. Generally, guidelines do  not support endoscopic gastrostomy in this clinical setting, but it may be the best option for nutritional support. OBJECTIVE: Retrospective evaluation of patients with dysphagia caused advanced esophageal cancer, no expectation of resuming oral intake and with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for comfort palliative nutrition. METHOD: We selected adult patients with unresecable esophageal cancer histological confirmed, in whom stenting was impossible due to  proximal location, and chemotherapy or radiotherapy were palliative, using gastrostomy for enteral nutrition. Clinical and nutritional data were evaluated,  including success of gastrostomy, procedure complications and survival after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, and evolution of body mass index, albumin, transferrin and cholesterol. RESULTS: Seventeen males with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 60.9 years. Most of the patients had toxic habits. All underwent palliative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Gastrostomy was successfully performed in all, but  nine required prior dilatation. Most had the gastrostomy within 2 months after diagnosis. There was a buried bumper syndrome treated with tube replacement and four minor complications. There were no cases of implantation metastases or procedure related mortality. Two patients were lost and 12 died. Mean survival of deceased patients was 5.9 months. Three patients are alive 6, 14 and 17 months after the gastrostomy procedure, still increasing the mean survival. Mean body mass index and laboratory parameters were roughly stable 1 and 3 months after the gastrostomy procedure. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced upper esophageal cancer where only palliative treatment is possible, nutritional support is easily achieved with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, allowing patients to be at homes, surviving a significant period of time.

BACKGROUND: Despite resection, the 5-year recurrence with localized stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 18.4%-24%. Aberrant Wnt signaling activation plays an important role in a wide variety of tumor types. However, there is not much known about the role the Wnt pathway plays in patients with stage I lung cancer. METHODS: Tumor and normal lung tissues from 55 patients following resection for stage I NSCLC were subjected to glutathione S-transferase (GST) E-cadherin pulldown and immunoblot analysis to assess levels of uncomplexed beta-catenin, a reliable measure of Wnt  signaling activation. The beta-catenin gene was also screened for oncogenic mutations in tumors with activated Wnt signaling. Cancer recurrence rates were correlated in a blinded manner in patients with Wnt pathway-positive and -negative tumors. RESULTS: Tumors in 20 patients (36.4%) scored as Wnt positive,  with only 1 exhibiting a beta-catenin oncogenic mutation. Patients with Wnt-positive tumors experienced a significantly higher rate of overall cancer recurrence than those with Wnt-negative tumors (30.0% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.02), with 25.0% exhibiting distal tumor recurrence compared with 2.9% in the Wnt-negative group (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Wnt pathway activation occurred in a substantial fraction of Stage I NSCLCs, which was rarely due to mutations. Moreover, Wnt pathway activation was associated with a significantly higher rate of tumor recurrence. These findings suggest that Wnt pathway activation reflects a more aggressive tumor phenotype and identifies patients who may benefit from more aggressive therapy in addition to resection.',\n",

This effect was observed only in patients treated with prophylaxis-dose aspirin (HR=0.89, CI=0.80-0.98) and only in patients taking aspirin before diagnosis (HR=0.86, CI=0.76-0.98). Differential effects were observed depending on the time after diagnosis. Up to 5 years, a reduction in mortality was observed for aspirin users (HR=0.83, CI=0.75-0.92), whereas after 10 years there was an increase in mortality (HR=1.94, CI=1.26-2.99). For NSAID use, no significant effect was observed on overall mortality (HR=1.07, CI=0.98-1.15). High-dose NSAID use was associated with a slight increase in mortality (HR=1.41, CI=1.26-1.56). INTERPRETATION: These findings provide further indication that aspirin may be beneficial in reducing mortality in colorectal cancer during the first 5 years. The same cannot be said for other NSAIDs, where  a small increase in mortality was observed.',\n",

Recently, a common variant on 6p22 (rs9393597) was found to be associated with increased breast cancer risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.25-1.92, p =  6.0 x 10(-5)]. This observation was based on data from GWAS studies in which, despite statistical correction for multiple comparisons, the possibility of false discovery remains a concern. Here, we report on an analysis of this variant in an additional 6,165 BRCA1 and 3,900 BRCA2 mutation carriers from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA).

Many cancer risk factors have been identified including increased blood levels of insulin, leptin, interleukin-6, interleukin-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and decreased blood levels of adiponectin. However, the role of blood levels of estrogen in obesity-associated colon cancer is controversial. Evidence showed that obesity affected men more strongly than women in the carcinogenesis of colon cancer, indicating protective effect of estrogen which is increased in obesity. However,  an epidemiological study has also shown that endogenous estradiol level is an independent risk factor for colon cancer, positively associated with colon cancer after normalizing insulin, IGF-1. The controversial opinions may be caused by different effects of ER-alpha and ER-beta. ER-alpha can increase colon cancer cell proliferation and increase cancer incidence. ER-beta has the opposite effect to ER-alpha, and it causes apoptosis of colon cancer cells. The normal colonocytes mainly express ER-beta. Therefore, increased estrogen in obesity may  have protective effect via ER-beta in obesity-associated colon cancer. However, with the development of colon cancer, ER-alpha is increased and ER-beta is decreased. In the late stage of colon cancer, estrogen may promote cancer development via ER-alpha. The different effects and expression of ER-alpha and ER-beta may explain the different results observed in several epidemiological studies as well as several animal experiments. Therefore, manipulation of estrogen-caused signal pathways to inhibit ER-alpha and stimulate ER-beta may have preventive and therapeutic effect for obesity-associated colon cancer.',\n",

In 2006, the federal government introduced a screening program consisting of a one-off fecal occult blood test offered to people turning 50, 55, or 65 years. We conducted a population-based study to estimate CRC screening practices existing outside the current program. METHODS: A total of 1887 unaffected subjects categorized \"at or slightly above average risk\" of CRC were selected from the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry. We calculated the proportions of participants that reported appropriate, under- and over-screening according to national guidelines. We performed a logistic regression analysis to evaluate associations between over-screening and a set of  socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: Of 532 participants at average risk of CRC, eligible for screening, 4 (0.75 %) reported appropriate screening, 479 (90 %) reported never having been screened, 18 (3 %) reported some but less than appropriate screening, and 31 (6 %) reported over-screening. Of 412 participants  aged 50 years or over, slightly above average risk of CRC, 1 participant (0.25 %) reported appropriate screening, 316 (77 %) reported no screening, and 11 (3 %) reported some but less than appropriate screening. Among participants under age 50 years, 2 % of those at average risk and 10 % of those slightly above average risk reported over-screening. Middle-aged people, those with a family history of  CRC and those with a university degree, were more likely to be over-screened. CONCLUSION: Overall, the level of CRC screening participation was low and the vast majority of screening tests undertaken were inappropriate in terms of timing, modality, or frequency.',\n",

A major barrier to trial entry may be distrust of research and the medical system. This may be compounded by the regulatory framework governing research with an emphasis on written consent, closed questions and consent documentation, as well as fiscal issues. The Leicester UK experience is that trial accrual is better if British South Asian patients are approached by a senior doctor rather than someone of perceived lesser hierarchical status and a greater partnership between the hospital and General Practitioner may increase trial participation of this particular ethnic minority. In Los Angeles, USA, trial recruitment was improved by a greater utilisation of Hispanic staff and a Spanish language-based education programme. Involvement of community leaders is essential. While adhering to national, legal and ethnical standards, information sheets and consent, it helps if forms can be tailored towards the local ethnic minority population. Written translations are often of limited value in the recruitment of patients with no or limited knowledge of English. In some cultural settings, tape-recorded verbal consent (following approval presentations) may be an acceptable substitute for written consent, and  appropriate legislative changes should be considered to facilitate this option. Approaches should be tailored to specific minority populations, taking consideration of their unique characteristics and with input from their community leadership.',\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 764 patients diagnosed with stage II colon cancer in  Denmark in the year 2003. One section from a representative paraffin-embedded tumour tissue specimen from each patient was processed for analysis of miR-21 and quantitatively assessed by image analysis. RESULTS: The miR-21 signal was predominantly observed in fibroblast-like cells located in the stromal compartment of the tumours. We found that patients expressing high levels of miR-21 had significantly inferior recurrence-free cancer-specific survival (RF-CSS): HR=1.26; 95% CI: 1.15-1.60; P<0.001. In Cox regression analysis, a high level of miR-21 retained its prognostic importance and was found to be significantly related to poor RF-CSS: HR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.19-1.67; P<0.001.

METHODS: Putative regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes from the ECM  pathway were genotyped in 613 CRC patients from Northern Germany (PopGen cohort)  and tested for association with disease progression and survival. RESULTS: The eSNP (SNP associated with expression) rs12695175 in CD47 associated with CRC specific survival (HR = 2.18, 95 % CI 1.10-4.33, CC versus AA) and with overall survival (HR = 1.99, 95 % CI 1.04-3.81, CC versus AA). This association remained  significant after adjustment for age at diagnosis, tumour stage (T) and lymph node status (N). Three polymorphisms in CD47 were associated with distant metastasis in a dominant model: rs9879947 and rs3206652 in the 3'-UTR (OR = 1.64, 95 % CI 1.01-2.64 and OR = 1.88, 95 % CI 1.27-2.80, respectively) and the eSNP rs3804639 (OR = 1.73, 95 % CI 1.17-2.57).

In this study, we evaluated the effects of oral GBE on hyperalgesia in a rat model of vincristine-induced neuropathy. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were injected intraperitoneally with vincristine or saline (0.1 mg/kg/d) using a 5-day-on, 2-day-off schedule over 12 days. All the behavioral tests for mechanical, cold, and heat hyperalgesia were conducted before the daily injection during the course of vincristine treatment. Rats that developed hyperalgesia 14 days after vincristine injection were randomly assigned into 4 groups.

We examined the hyperalgesia at preadministration and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after oral drug administration. RESULTS: Saline injection did not have any significant effect on mechanical, cold, and heat hyperalgesia. Vincristine injection produced mechanical and cold hyperalgesia. For the GBE groups, the paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli was significantly increased and withdrawal frequency to cold stimuli was significantly reduced versus the control group dose-dependently (P < 0.05).

Some of these initiatives include: 1) discovery and validation of predictive markers that can prospectively identify patients more likely to benefit from antiangiogenic therapy; 2) recognition that the nature of the chemotherapy partner or backbone can strongly impact outcomes when combined with antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab, and thus developing what may be improved combination chemotherapy partner regimens, e.g. metronomic chemotherapy; 3) evaluating prospectively in more depth whether subtypes of the disease-especially triple negative or inflammatory breast cancer-are more responsive to antiangiogenic therapy than other subtypes; 4) evaluating new agents that inhibit angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner and other types of drug that can be effectively combined  with antiangiogenics, e.g. c-met inhibitors; 5) uncovering the basis of resistance or relapse/progression on the therapy with antiangiogenic drugs; 6) development of improved predictive preclinical breast cancer models for therapy testing, e.g. treatment of mice with established multi-organ breast cancer metastatic disease or genetically engineered mouse models of breast cancer, or mice bearing patient derived breast cancer tissue xenografts.',\n",

Despite improved screening and therapies to treat breast cancers, metastasis continues to undermine these advances. The pervasive albatross of metastasis necessitates improved prevention and treatment of metastasis. To this  end, clinicians routinely employ post-operative or adjuvant therapy to decrease the risk of future metastasis and improve the chance for cure. This article evaluates the limitations of breast cancer therapies within the context of growth curves, and in doing so, provides new insight into the metastatic process as well as more effective means for therapeutic delivery. Two critical developments evolve from this mathematical analysis: first, the use of dose dense chemotherapy to improve survival among breast cancer patients; and second, the theory of self-seeding, which fundamentally changes our understanding of metastasis and the trajectory of drug development.',\n",

Current imaging methods have limited accuracy in predicting lymph node metastasis. We sought to identify protein markers in primary gastric cancer and to define a risk model to predict lymph node metastasis. The Protein Pathway Array (PPA) (initial selection) and Western blot  (confirmation) were used to assess the protein expression in a total of 190 freshly frozen gastric cancer samples. The protein expression levels were compared between samples with lymph node metastasis (n = 73) and those without lymph node metastasis (n = 57) using PPA. There were 27 proteins differentially expressed between lymph node positive samples and lymph node negative samples. Five proteins (Factor XIII B, TFIIH p89, ADAM8, COX-2 and CUL-1) were identified  as independent predictors of lymph node metastasis. Together with vascular/lymphatic invasion status, a risk score model was established to determine the risk of lymph node metastasis for each individual gastric cancer patient. The ability of this model to predict lymph node metastasis was further confirmed in a second cohort of gastric cancer patients (33 with and 27 without lymph node metastasis) using Western blot. This study indicated that some proteins differentially expressed in gastric cancer can be selected as clinically useful biomarkers. The risk score model is useful for determining patients' risk  of lymph node metastasis and prognosis.\",\n",

The growth pattern of this cancer may also affect its appearance on sonography. Our study evaluated the sonographic features of TNBC according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System sonographic classification system and compared these features with those of non-TNBC. METHODS: Data from 315 consecutive breast cancer cases were collected. The images were reevaluated by an examiner blinded to the patients' characteristics and histologic results according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. The sonographic features of TNBC (n = 33) and non-TNBC (n = 282) were compared. RESULTS: Triple-negative breast cancer was significantly correlated with a younger patient age (P = .002) and was associated with higher tumor grades (P < .001), more lymph node involvement (P = .014), and a trend toward a larger tumor size. With regard  to sonographic features, the margin of TNBC was more frequently described as lobulated or microlobulated (75.8% versus 49.5% in non-TNBC; P = .005). The echoic halo was observed significantly less often in TNBC than in non-TNBC(39.4%  versus 62.8%; P = .014). Cooper ligaments were displaced rather than disrupted in TNBC compared to non-TNBC (P = .003). Regarding the posterior acoustic features,  enhancement was observed significantly more often in TNBC (36.4% versus 13.0% in  non-TNBC; P = .031). CONCLUSIONS: Triple-negative breast cancer and non-TNBC have different sonographic features. This finding can be explained by the pathologic profile of this breast cancer subtype. Some of the distinct sonographic criteria  for TNBC are more likely to be associated with benign masses. Knowledge of the distinct sonographic features of TNBC would help the examiner avoid false-negative classification of this tumor type.\",\n",

METHODS: Target receptor expression of 2LMP breast cancer cells was quantified by flow cytometric analysis and characterization established with antibodies against mouse alpha(V)beta3- integrin, P-selectin, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Tumor-bearing mice (n = 15 per group) underwent contrast-enhanced US  imaging of multitargeted microbubbles. Microbubble accumulation was calculated by destruction-replenishment techniques and time-intensity curve analysis. On day 0, mice underwent baseline imaging. Next, therapy group mice were injected with a 0.2-mg dose of bevacizumab, and controls received matched saline injections. Imaging was repeated on days 1 and 3. After imaging was completed on day 3, the mice were euthanized and tumors excised. Histologic analysis of microvessel density and intratumoral necrosis was completed on tumor sections. RESULTS: On day 3 after bevacizumab dosing, a 71.8% change in tumor vasculature was shown between the therapy and control groups (P = .01).

However, the role of MSP in cancer metastasis is still largely unknown. In this study, the action of MSP on the production of metastases was determined in a multiple-organ metastasis model. The murine MSP gene was transfected into two human SCLC cell lines, SBC-5 and H1048, to establish transfectants secreting biologically active MSP. MSP gene transduction did not affect cell proliferation and motility in vitro. Intravenously inoculated MSP transfectants produced significantly larger numbers of liver metastases than parental cells or vector control clones, while there were no significant differences in bone or lung metastases among them. Immunohistochemical analyses of liver metastases revealed that tumor-associated microvessel density and tumor-infiltrating macrophages were significantly increased in lesions produced by MSP transfectants. MSP could stimulate the migration of murine macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro.

This review describes therapeutic approaches to patients with recurrent sporadic MTC, management of advanced cases of MTC, and future treatment options. A literature review of treatment of MTC in humans was conducted. Surgery is currently the only potentially curative treatment for MTC; complete tumor resection and removal of suspicious nodes is the most important initial treatment to prevent recurrence and metastasis. When recurrence or metastatic MTC develops, the decision for continued observation or initiation of systemic therapy is based on the degree of tumor aggressiveness. Lymph node involvement, calcitonin doubling time, types of  RET mutation, and tumor stage are factors that help determine the need for further treatment. Therapeutic options for aggressive and inoperable MTC primarily include tyrosine kinase inhibitors, external beam radiation therapy, or other medications. Among tyrosine kinase inhibitors, vandetanib is the first drug that is FDA approved for treatment of MTC. Focused external beam radiation therapy can be reconsidered for patients with cervical node involvement. Although other targeted drug therapies have been tried, definitive clinical studies are lacking. In recurrent or advanced MTC, when systemic therapy is warranted, vandetanib is available for use in treatment; however, side effects of this drug  can be problematic, and impact on overall survival is presently unknown.

For IGFBP-3 nuclear staining, PCa was significantly different than benign prostatic hyperplasia, normal prostate, and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. As both a continuous and dichotomized variable, higher nuclear IGFBP-3 expression had statistically significant associations with PCa recurrence. The cytoplasmic staining had no significance in any patient subgroup. In patients with low-grade  cancer, IGFBP-3 nuclear positivity was a better predictor of recurrence than baseline PSA, tumor margin status, TNM tumor stage, or presence of capsular invasion.

OBJECTIVES: To identify social determinants of health (SDH) associated  with cervical screening for women living in middle and low-income countries, to inform responses to improve SDH and screening coverage, and to identify research  gaps. METHODS: A scoping literature review. We located original research articles on SDH associated with cervical cancer screening through bibliographic databases, supplemented by hand searching (n=166+4). Included were those conducted in middle and low-income countries and published in English, Portuguese and Spanish academic journals between January 2000 and June 2011 (n=37). Excluded were those  from high-income countries or focusing on screening-diagnostic techniques or HPV  vaccine. Narrative synthesis examined the results in relation to a SDH framework. RESULTS: A number of factors influence access along the pathway to cervical cancer screening. Structural (cultural and societal values, socioeconomic position, ethnicity), intermediary (geographic location, health seeking behaviours, psychosocial factors, nature of the health system), and cross-cutting (social cohesion) SDH were all important. No single factor could entirely explain the observed cervical screening patterns. CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer screening among women living in middle and low-income countries are influenced by the interaction among several different SDH. The majority of researchers studying cervical cancer screening focused on exploring single socio-demographic variables, which is typical of positivist, biomedical and epidemiological research. An inter-sectionality approach may provide a richer understanding of the complexities that influence women's pathways to cervical cancer screening and assist design of international programmes and policies from a social justice perspective.\",\n",

RESULTS: The levels of the HNPs increased from grade 1 to 4 tumors and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Additionally, plasma HNP levels were significantly higher in patients with metastatic bladder cancer and in patients with lymphovascular involvement, metastasis of the lymph nodes, and increased tumor burden (p < 0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was planned and conducted according to international recommendations. All patients referred for pretherapeutic staging of primary breast cancer during 24 consecutive months were included into the study collective. They were followed-up by our multidisciplinary breast center. For semi-quantitative MRI-analysis dedicated CAD-software (computer assisted diagnosis) was used. Association between enhancement parameters and disease-related survival was investigated using Cox proportional-hazards -regression (CR). RESULTS: A total of 115 patients were eligible for CR analysis. Median follow-up time was 52 months. In 15 patients, disease-related death occurred. CR analysis identified four enhancement parameters as independent and significant (P < 0.001) predictors of the endpoint. Coefficients were \"Initial enhancement\" (B = 0.0166), \"Time to peak-enhancement\" (B = 1.0573), \"Tumor volume\" (B = 0.0175), and proportion of \"tumor volume\" showing \"slow initial enhancement\" followed by a \"persistent\" curve-type (B = -0.0586). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the significant relationship between semi-quantitative enhancement analysis in breast MRI and disease-related death of breast cancer patients.

However, the  means by which Slug activity is controlled remain unclear. Herein we identify an  unrecognized canonical Wnt/GSK3beta/beta-Trcp1 axis that controls Slug activity.  In the absence of Wnt signaling, Slug is phosphorylated by GSK3beta and subsequently undergoes beta-Trcp1-dependent ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Alternatively, in the presence of canonical Wnt ligands, GSK3beta kinase activity is inhibited, nuclear Slug levels increase, and EMT programs are  initiated. Consistent with recent studies describing correlative associations in  basal-like breast cancers between Wnt signaling, increased Slug levels, and reduced expression of the tumor suppressor Breast Cancer 1, Early Onset (BRCA1),  further studies demonstrate that Slug-as well as Snail-directly represses BRCA1 expression by recruiting the chromatin-demethylase, LSD1, and binding to a series of E-boxes located within the BRCA1 promoter. Consonant with these findings, nuclear Slug and Snail expression are increased in association with BRCA1 repression in a cohort of triple-negative breast cancer patients. Together, these findings establish unique functional links between canonical Wnt signaling, Slug  expression, EMT, and BRCA1 regulation.',\n",

Type I tumors are  estrogen-related, low-grade endometrioid tumors, whereas type II tumors are aggressive, high-grade non-endometrioid tumors. Ret finger protein is a nuclear transcription factor with a tripartite motif that is highly expressed in different tumor cells. MATERIAL AND METHOD: To analyze the expression of ret finger protein in endometrial tissues and cancer, 18 cases of secretory and proliferative endometrium, endometrial polyp, endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia and 21 cases of types I and II endometrial  carcinoma were evaluated immunohistochemically. RESULTS: Although rare cases of secretory endometrium showed a weak focal nuclear positivity, remaining proliferative endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia and type I endometrioid cancer cases were negative. In contrast, all cases of serous cancers showed strong nuclear positivity. After these strong positive results for serous endometrial cancer, 12 more cases of ovarian and endometrial serous carcinoma cases were added to the study. All of the additional cases were also strongly positive for ret finger protein. CONCLUSION: We suggest that ret finger protein might play a role in the carcinogenesis of the serous tumors of gynecological system and can be used to differentiate serous carcinomas from other epithelial tumors.',\n",

Our objective was to investigate the role of serous borderline tumors and their accompanying extraovarian lesions in pathogenesis of serous ovarian cancer using immunohistochemistry as a tool. MATERIAL AND METHOD: An immunohistochemical panel of p16, p53, CD24, EpCAM and calretinin was applied to cutting edge matrix assembly-like tissue arrays of 46 cases consisting of typical, focal micropapillary, micropapillary, microinvasive, cystadenoma, and low-grade carcinoma cases. These tissue arrays are better choices than conventional tissue arrays to examine thin walled and heterogenous neoplasia like serous borderline tumors as they facilitate the analysis with linear sections rather than a core. RESULTS: For two tumor supressor gene markers; no diffuse and strong expression of p53, and strong and patchy/heterogenous expression of p16 were detected in all cases. Focal and strong calretinin expression was detected in micropapillary tumors while expression of EpCAM was lost in the same areas. Strong cytoplasmic CD24 expression was detected in cases with peritoneal implants, favoring the theory that change of expression localization of cell adhesion molecules is in accordance with phenotypical changes and tumor progresssion. Furthermore, circumfrential membranous and cytoplasmic expression of CD24 and EpCAM was detected in neoplastic cells in lymph nodes and microinvasion areas.

Recently, nanotechnology has emerged as a powerful tool in addressing some of the barriers to drug delivery, including MDR in cancer, by utilizing alternate routes of cellular entry and targeted delivery of drugs and genes. However, it is unclear whether doxorubicin (Dox) can be delivered by nanotechnologic approaches. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether (1) Dox-loaded lipid-functionalized dextran-based biocompatible nanoparticles (Dox/NP) can reverse MDR, (2) Dox/NP has more potent cytotoxic effect on MDR tumors than poly(ethylene glycol)-modified liposomal Dox (PLD), and (3) multidrug resistance  protein 1 (MDR1) small interfering RNA loaded in these nanoparticles (siMDR1/NP)  can modulate MDR. METHODS: To create stable Dox/NP and siMDR1/NP, we used two different lipid-modified dextran derivatives. The effect of Dox or Dox/NP was tested on drug-sensitive osteosarcoma (KHOS) and ovarian cancer (SKOV-3) cell cultures in triplicate and their respective MDR counterparts KHOS(R2) and SKOV-3(TR) in triplicate. We determined the effects on drug retention, transfection efficacy of siMDR1/NP, and P-glycoprotein expression and the antiproliferative effect between Dox/NP and PLD in MDR tumor cells. RESULTS: Fluorescence microscopy revealed efficient uptake of the Dox/NP and fluorescently tagged siMDR1/NP. Dox/NP showed five- to 10-fold higher antiproliferative activity at the 50% inhibitory concentration than free Dox in tumor cells. Dox/NP showed twofold higher activity than PLD in MDR tumor cells. siMDR1/NP (100 nM) suppressed P-glycoprotein expression in KHOS(R2). CONCLUSIONS: Dextran-lipid nanoparticles are a promising platform for delivering Dox and siRNAs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biocompatible dextran-based nanoparticles that are directly translatable to clinical medicine may lead to new potential therapeutics for reversing MDR in patients with cancer.',\n",

Polyps are classified histologically as conventional adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/P) and traditional serrated adenomas (TSA). However, the association of these polyps with the different types of CRCs and the underlying genetic and epigenetic aberrations has yet to be resolved. In order to address this question we analyzed 140 tumors and 20 matched mucosae by array comparative  genomic hybridization, by sequence analysis of the oncogenes BRAF, KRAS, PI3K3CA  and by methylation arrays. MSI was tested indirectly by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and a loss of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 was assigned as high microsatellite  instability (MSI-H), while low microsatellite instability (MSI-L) was defined as  MGMT IHC negativity only. CIN was detected in 78% of all MSI-H CRCs, most commonly as a gain of chromosome 8. Methylation data analyses allowed classification of samples into four groups and detected similar methylation profiles in SSA/P and MSI-H CRC. TSA also revealed aberrant methylation pattern,  but clustered more heterogeneously and closer to microsatellite stable (MSS) CRCs. SSA/P, TSA and MSI-H CRCs had the highest degree of promotor methylation (CIMP pathway). Chromosomal instability, in contrast to the established doctrine, is a common phenomenon in MSI CRCs, yet to a lower extent and at later stages than in MSS CRCs. Methylation analyses suggest that SSA/P are precursors for MSI-H CRCs and follow the CIMP pathway.',\n",

We genotyped 310 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and a control group of 348 cancer-free individuals for seven sequence variants located in CHRNA3 and CHRNA5 genes. Two of the polymorphisms (rs3829787  and rs3841324) statistically influenced the risk of developing lung cancer. We found that four of the variants (rs3829787, rs3841324, rs588765 and rs3743073) were associated with differential levels of genetic alterations measured as the levels of hydrophobic DNA adducts in the adjacent histologically normal tissue of the lung cancer patients and as TP53 mutations in their lung tumors. The seven sequence variants formed three haplotypes with a frequency above 5%. The two most frequent haplotypes were associated with the risk of developing lung cancer and with smoking-related DNA alterations. We also found an association between CHRNA5 mRNA levels and the sequence variants or haplotypes. In conclusion, our results showed that several of the polymorphisms and their haplotypes in CHRNA5/CHRNA3 genes may have functional effects on (i) CHRNA5 mRNA levels, (ii) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adduct levels, (iii) TP53 mutations and (iv) susceptibility to lung cancer.',\n",

With DUBs arising as novel potential drug targets, probes are required that can be produced in sufficient amounts and to meet the specific needs of a given experiment. The established method for the generation of DUB probes makes use of labor-intensive intein-based methods that have inherent limitations concerning the incorporation of unnatural amino acids and the amount of material that can be obtained. Here, we describe the total chemical synthesis of active-site-directed probes and their application to activity-based profiling and identification of functional DUBs. This synthetic methodology allowed the easy incorporation of desired tags for specific applications, for example, fluorescent reporters, handles for immunoprecipitation or affinity pull-down, and cleavable linkers. Additionally, the synthetic method  can be scaled up to provide significant amounts of probe. Fluorescent ubiquitin probes allowed faster, in-gel detection of active DUBs, as compared to (immuno)blotting procedures. A biotinylated probe holding a photocleavable linker enabled the affinity pull-down and subsequent mild, photorelease of DUBs. Also, DUB activity levels were monitored in response to overexpression or knockdown, and to inhibition by small molecules.

Co-administration of HDACI with proteasome inhibitors (PIs), which interrupt NFkappaB pathways, may enhance HDACI-lethality. The goal of this study was to determine whether PIs could potentiate HDACI, scriptaid (SCP)-mediated lethality, to unravel the associated mechanisms and to assess the effects of the combined inhibition of HDAC and proteasome on chemotherapy response in human colorectal cancer cells. Cancer cells were exposed to agents alone or in combination; cell growth inhibition was  determined by MTT and colony formation assays. HDAC-, proteasome-, NFkappaB-activities, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified. Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle alterations were monitored by flow cytometry. Expression of cell cycle/apoptosis and cytoprotective/stress-related genes was determined by real-time qRT-PCR and EIA, respectively. Potentiation of cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapies by SCP/PIs was also evaluated. SCP and PIs: MG132, PI-1, or epoxomicin interact synergistically to potently inhibit cancer cell growth, alter cell cycle, induce apoptosis, reduce NFkappaB activity, and increase ROS generation. These events are associated with multiple perturbations  in the expression of cell cycle, apoptosis, cytoprotective, and stress-related genes. Co-administration of SCP and PIs strikingly increases the chemosensitivity of cancer cells (122-2 x 10(5)-fold) in a drug and SCP/PIs-dependent manner.

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1988 and 2006 were identified through the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, in Southern California. Patients were stratified into 4 age groups: 18-49, 50-64, 65-79, and >/=80 years. Clinical and  pathologic characteristics and disease-specific and overall survival were compared between patients from different age groups. RESULTS: A total of 32,819 patients were assessed. Patients aged 18 to 49 and 65 to 79 years represented the smallest and largest groups, respectively. A near equal number of males and females were diagnosed with colon cancer in the 3 youngest age groups, whereas patients who were >/=80 years old were more commonly white and female. Tumor location was different between groups, and the frequency of larger tumors (>5 cm) was greatest in youngest patients (18-49 years). The oldest patients (>/=80 years) were administered chemotherapy at the lowest frequency, and disease-specific and overall survival rates decreased with increasing age.

The capture of HIF-1alpha by pVHL is regulated by an oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of a specific conserved prolyl residue. The VHL gene is mutated in the von Hippel-Lindau cancer predisposition syndrome, which is characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors and is associated  with constitutively high levels of HIF-1alpha. The disturbance of the dynamic coupling between HIF-1alpha and pVHL bearing the commonly found mutation F76del was experimentally confirmed but the mechanism of such complex disruption is still not clear. Performing unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the F76del mutation may enlarge the HIF binding pocket in pVHL and induce the formation of an internal cavity in the hydrophobic core of the beta-domain, which can lead to a partial destabilization of the beta-sheets S1, S4, and S7 and a consequent loss of hydrogen bonds with a conserved recognition motif in HIF. The  newly formed cavity has a significant druggability score and may be a suitable target for stabilizing ligands. Studies of this nature may help to fill the information gap between genotype-phenotype correlations with details obtained at  atomic level and provide basis for future development of drug candidates, such as pharmacological chaperones, with the specific aim of reverting the dysfunction of such pathological protein complexes found in patients with VHL.',\n",

GOC refers to chemotherapy treatment intent: cure versus noncure. In this study, the authors sought to determine whether attributes of patients and initial patient-physician  encounters were associated with patients' understanding of their GOC. METHODS: In total, the authors surveyed 125 consecutive, newly diagnosed patients who were receiving chemotherapy for solid malignancies at a single academic cancer center  and performed a medical record review for additional data. Patient understanding  of their oncologist's GOC and oncologist's reported GOC were compared. The primary outcome was concordance of patient-physician dyads regarding the GOC (cure vs noncure). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five of 137 of eligible patients (91%) completed the survey. Only 95 of 125 patient-physician pairs (75%) patient-physician pairs were concordant regarding the GOC. In a multivariable logistic regression, both older patients (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.57) and non-native English speakers had an almost 80% lower odds (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.93) of GOC concordance compared with younger patients and native English speakers. Patients who received printed chemotherapy information during the patient-physician consent process had almost 3 times greater odds (odds ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-6.68) of GOC concordance with their physician compared with those who did not receive materials. CONCLUSIONS: Patient misunderstanding of GOC was substantial, with 25% of cancer patients misunderstanding the goal of their chemotherapy treatment. Key predictors of GOC misunderstanding included factors that potentially were amenable to interventions at the time of chemotherapy consent.\",\n",

Both of those trials reported that clinically positive lymph nodes  and male sex predicted poorer overall survival (OS). The EORTC 22861 trial indicated that the same factors were prognostic for locoregional control. In the  current report, the authors investigated potential prognostic factors from the first United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research Anal Cancer Trial  (ACT I), in which patients were randomized to receive either radiotherapy alone or chemoradiation (CRT) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin C. METHODS: In the ACT I trial, associations between several baseline characteristics and 3 endpoints were investigated: locoregional failure (LRF), anal cancer death (ACD), and OS. The analyses were restricted to 292 patients who received CRT, which subsequently became standard treatment. A score was derived using multivariable Cox regression to identify the set of factors that, together, had the best prognostic performance. This score was then validated with a large, independent prospective trial (the ACT II trial). RESULTS: Palpable, clinically positive lymph nodes were associated with LRF (P = .012), a greater risk of ACD (P = .031), and decreased OS (P = .006) in multivariable analyses. Men had worse outcomes than women for LRF (P = .036), ACD (P = .039), and OS (P = .008). On average, a lower hemoglobin level had an adverse effect on ACD (P = .008), and a  higher white blood cell count had an adverse effect on OS (P = .001). However, external validation of the score was poor for LRF (area under the curve [AUC] = 54%) but was better for ACD (AUC = 67%) and OS (AUC = 63%). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this analysis of the ACT I trial supported evidence for palpable lymph nodes and male sex as prognostic factors for LRF and OS, and lower hemoglobin levels and a higher white blood cell count were identified as prognostic factors for ACD and OS, respectively.',\n",

The authors of this report examined receipt and completion of adjuvant trastuzumab by race/ethnicity  and education for women with HER2-positive disease. METHODS: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Breast Cancer Outcomes Database was used to identify 1109 women who were diagnosed with stage I through III, HER2-positive breast cancer during September 2005 through December 2008 and were followed for >/=1 year. The authors used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association of race/ethnicity and education with the receipt of trastuzumab and,  among those women who initiated trastuzumab, with the completion of > 270 days of therapy. RESULTS: The cohort was 75% white, 8% black, and 9% Hispanic; and 20% of women had attained a high school degree or less. Most women (83%) received trastuzumab, and no significant differences were observed according to race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status.

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of ESD and TEM for superficial  early rectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 63 patients with nonpolypoid rectal high grade dysplasia or submucosa-invading cancer who were treated with ESD or TEM, and compared clinical outcomes and safety between the treatment groups. RESULTS: 30 patients underwent ESD and 33 underwent TEM. For ESD compared with TEM, en bloc resection rates were 96.7% vs.  100% (P = 0.476) and R0 resection rates were 96.7 % vs. 97.0 % (P = 1.000). There were no cases of local recurrence or distant metastasis in either group. Antibiotics were required in 11 patients (36.7%) in the ESD group and 33 (100%) in the TEM group (P < 0.001). There was no difference in net procedure time although ESD was associated with shorter total procedure time and hospital stay than TEM, with mean (standard deviation [SD]) 84.0 (51.2) vs. 116.4 (58.5) min (P = 0.0023), and 3.6 (1.2) vs. 6.6 (3.5) days (P < 0.001), respectively. There were no significant differences in complications between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS:  Both ESD and TEM are effective and oncologically safe for treating nonpolypoid rectal high grade dysplasia and submucosa-invading cancers. ESD has the additional advantages of minimal invasiveness and avoidance of anesthesia. Therefore, ESD could be recommended as a treatment option for superficial early rectal cancers.',\n",

To date, there is no approved targeted therapy for TNBCs. Aurora kinases act as regulators of mammalian cell division. They are important for cell-cycle progression and are frequently overexpressed or mutated in human tumors, including breast cancer. In  this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting Aurora kinases in preclinical models of human breast cancers using a pan-inhibitor of Aurora kinases, AS703569. In vitro, AS703569 was tested in 15 human breast cancer cell lines. TNBC cell lines were more sensitive to AS703569 than were other types of breast cancer cells. Inhibition of proliferation was associated with cell-cycle arrest, aneuploidy, and apoptosis. In vivo, AS703569 administered alone significantly inhibited tumor growth in seven of 11 patient-derived breast cancer xenografts. Treatment with AS703569 was associated with a decrease of phospho-histone H3 expression. Finally, AS703569 combined to doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide significantly inhibited in vivo tumor recurrence, suggesting that Aurora kinase inhibitors could be used both in monotherapy and in combination settings. In conclusion, these data indicate that targeting Aurora kinases could represent a new effective approach for TNBC treatment.',\n",

Despite recent improvement in the treatment outcome of multiple myeloma by novel molecular-targeted chemotherapeutics, multiple myeloma  remains incurable. The identification of a therapeutic target molecule in which various signaling for cell-survival converge is a core component for the development of new therapeutic strategies against multiple myeloma. RSK2 is an essential mediator of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway for cell survival and proliferation. In this study, we discovered that RSK2(Ser227), which is located at the N-terminal kinase domain and is one site responsible for substrate phosphorylation, is activated through phosphorylation regardless of the type of cytogenetic abnormalities or upstream molecular signaling in all 12 multiple myeloma-derived cell lines examined and 6 of 9 patient-derived CD138-positive primary myeloma cells. The chemical inhibition of RSK2(Ser227) by BI-D1870 or gene knockdown of RSK2 inhibits myeloma cell proliferation through apoptosis induction, and this anti-myeloma effect was accompanied by downregulation of c-MYC, cyclin D, p21(WAF1/CIP1), and MCL1. RSK2(Ser227) inhibition resulting from BI-D1870 treatment restored lenalidomide-induced direct cytotoxicity of myeloma cells from interleukin-6-mediated cell protection, showed no cross-resistance to  bortezomib, and exerted additive/synergistic antiproliferative effects in conjunction with the mTOR, histone deacetylase, and BH3-mimicking BCL2/BCLX(L) inhibitors. These results suggest that RSK2(Ser227) is a potential therapeutic target not only for newly diagnosed but also for patients with later phase multiple myeloma who are resistant or refractory to currently available anti-myeloma therapies.',\n",

We hypothesized that antiapoptotic signals contribute to resistance and that treatment with proapoptotic agents could increase the efficacy of conventional therapies. A PCR array was used to assess the status of the apoptotic signaling pathway in medulloblastoma cells after treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Treatment with cisplatin led to the upregulation of antiapoptotic signals, including inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP), in medulloblastoma cells. We subsequently investigated the synergistic effect of a small-molecule IAP inhibitor, LBW242, in combination with cisplatin and/or radiotherapy in three human medulloblastoma cell lines and 5 short term primary patient medulloblastoma cultures. The addition of LBW242 to chemotherapy resulted in significantly increased antitumor activity with a similar effect observed in combination with radiotherapy. Measurement of caspase-8 and -9 activity indicated that the synergy resulted from induction of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin V staining and activation of caspases 3/7. Xenograft models were used to evaluate the mechanism of action and efficacy in vivo. The combination therapy significantly reduced the tumor burden in a medulloblastoma xenograft model and TUNEL analysis in a medulloblastoma orthograft confirmed in vivo induction of apoptosis.

NSCLC tumors with oncogenic KRAS respond poorly to current therapies, necessitating the pursuit of new treatment strategies. Targeted inhibition of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 results in the coordinated blockade of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways in tumor cells and has thus emerged as an attractive avenue for therapeutic intervention in human malignancies. Here, we examined the activity of ganetespib, a small-molecule inhibitor of Hsp90 currently in clinical trials for NSCLCs in a panel of lung cancer cell lines harboring a diverse spectrum of KRAS mutations. In vitro, ganetespib was potently cytotoxic in all lines, with concomitant destabilization of KRAS signaling effectors. Combinations of low-dose ganetespib with MEK or PI3K/mTOR inhibitors resulted in superior cytotoxic activity than single agents alone in a subset of mutant KRAS cells, and the antitumor efficacy of ganetespib was potentiated by cotreatment with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 in A549 xenografts in vivo. At the molecular level, ganetespib suppressed activating feedback signaling loops that occurred in response to MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition, although this activity was not the sole determinant of combinatorial benefit. In addition, ganetespib sensitized mutant KRAS NSCLC cells to standard-of-care chemotherapeutics of the antimitotic, topoisomerase inhibitor, and alkylating agent classes. Taken together, these data underscore the promise of ganetespib as a single-agent or combination treatment in KRAS-driven lung tumors.',\n",

The average annual age-standardised incidence rate of all eyelid cancers over the 13 years was 5.0 per million. A significant decrease in rates from 6.6 per million in the 1996-1998 period to 3.9 per million in the 2005-2008 period with an annual percentage change of 3.6% (95% CI -6.5 to  0.7%; p=0.02) was noted for women. The most common cancer was basal cell carcinoma (82%), followed by sebaceous gland carcinoma (11%) and squamous cell carcinoma (4%). CONCLUSIONS: The annual age-standardised incidence rates for male and female residents showed a steady decline over the last 13 years. These data suggest that factors related to sun protection have resulted in reduced eyelid cancers over time and provide a basis for such public health programmes elsewhere.',\n",

It was revealed that both  ACA and CDDP induced dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity when used as a stand-alone agent, while synergistic effects were observed when used in combination with a combination index (CI) value of 0.74 +/- 0.01 and 0.85 +/- 0.01 in Ca Ski and HeLa cells, respectively. A total of 25 miRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed in response to ACA and/or CDDP. These include hsa-miR-138, hsa-miR-210, and hsa-miR-744 with predicted gene targets involved in signaling pathways regulating apoptosis and cell cycle progression. In conclusion, ACA acts as a chemosensitizer which synergistically potentiates the cytotoxic effect of CDDP in cervical cancer cells.

Internal tandem duplication mutations of the FLT3 kinase (FLT3/ITD) occur commonly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor survival, leading to efforts to develop FLT3 kinase inhibitors. However, FLT3 inhibitors have thus far met with limited success, inducing only a clearance of peripheral blasts with minimal BM responses. Quizartinib is a novel potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor currently being studied in clinical trials. In 13 of 14 FLT3/ITD AML patients with normal karyotype treated with quizartinib, we observed terminal myeloid differentiation of BM blasts in association with a clinical differentiation syndrome. The single patient whose blasts failed to differentiate had a preexisting C/EBPalpha mutation and another developed a C/EBPalpha mutation at disease progression, suggesting a mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibition.  In vitro, in primary blasts cocultured with human BM stroma, FLT3 inhibition with quizartinib induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation rather than apoptosis.

Mechanism dissection revealed that the differential methylation pattern in the AR promoter  could be due to differential expression of methyltransferases and binding of methylation binding protein to the AR promoter region. The low expression of AR in normal prostate/PCa stem/progenitor cells was reversed after adding 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a demethylating agent, which could then lead to decreased stemness and drive cells into a more differentiated status, suggesting that the methylation in the AR promoter of prostate stem/progenitor cells is critical not  only in maintaining the stemness but also critical in protection of cells from differentiation. Furthermore, induced AR expression, via alteration of its methylation pattern, led to suppression of the self-renewal/proliferation of prostate stem/progenitor cells and PCa tumorigenesis in both in vitro assays and  in vivo orthotopic xenografted mouse studies. Taken together, these data prove the unique methylation pattern of AR promoter in normal prostate/PCa stem/progenitor cells and the influence of AR on their renewal/proliferation and  differentiation.

DATA SOURCES: Relevant published data were identified using PubMed from inception to April 2012 using the search terms fentanyl nasal spray, intranasal fentanyl, intranasal fentanyl cancer pain, and fentanyl pectin cancer pain. Only articles evaluating the use of intranasal fentanyl spray for cancer pain were selected. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles evaluating the pharmacokinetics of intranasal fentanyl or the clinical efficacy of intranasal fentanyl spray for the treatment of BTCP were considered; references of selected articles were manually reviewed to identify further articles. The manufacturer of intranasal fentanyl spray was also contacted to obtain information. DATA SYNTHESIS: Intranasal fentanyl spray gained Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of BTCP in adults with cancer receiving stable background opioid therapy for chronic pain. In doses ranging from 100 to 800 mug/spray, intranasal fentanyl spray was found to be more effective than placebo and more effective than oral morphine or oral fentanyl formulations in reducing pain for up to 15-45 minutes; onset of analgesia was also improved with intranasal fentanyl spray. The most commonly observed adverse  events included nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of BTCP, intranasal fentanyl spray offers improved onset of analgesia compared to other oral therapies; this improved onset of analgesia may closely mimic the typical time course of a BTCP episode. Nasal administration may overcome problems such as nausea, vomiting, or xerostomia that may complicate oral administration of analgesics. Potential disadvantages include uncertainty in treating more than 4 BTCP episodes per 24 hours and a higher cost compared to generically available oral opioid analgesics.',\n",

However, the requirement for CD24 (Cd24a in mice) in tumorigenesis and spontaneous metastasis from the orthotopic site remains uncharacterized. Using N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine induction of invasive and metastatic bladder cancer, we show that Cd24a-deficient male mice developed fewer bladder tumors than C57BL/6 control male mice. Evaluating only mice with evidence of primary tumors, we observed that Cd24a-deficient male mice also had fewer metastases than wild-type counterparts.  In parallel observations, stratification of patients based on CD24 immunohistochemical expression in their tumors revealed that high levels of CD24  are associated with poor prognosis in males. In female patients and mice the above observations were not present. Given the significant role of CD24 in males, we sought to assess the relationship between androgen and CD24 regulation. We discovered that androgen receptor knockdown in UM-UC-3 and TCCSUP human urothelial carcinoma cell lines resulted in suppression of CD24 expression and cell proliferation. Androgen treatment also led to increased CD24 promoter activity, dependent on the presence of androgen receptor. In vivo, androgen deprivation resulted in reduced growth and CD24 expression of UM-UC-3 xenografts, and the latter was rescued by exogenous CD24 overexpression. These findings demonstrate an important role for CD24 in urothelial tumorigenesis and metastasis in male mice and indicate that CD24 is androgen regulated, providing the foundation for urothelial bladder cancer therapy with antiandrogens.',\n",

Here, we used 2D and 3D  Matrigel, anchorage-independent growth conditions and a breast cancer xenograft mouse model to assess the impact of nicastrin on breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) propagation and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Stable knockdown of nicastrin in HCC1806 breast cancer cells reduced cell invasion by 51.4 +/- 1.7%,  accompanied by a morphological change to a rounded cell phenotype and down-regulation of vimentin, Snail, Twist, MMP2, and MMP9. We observed a reduction of the pool of CD44(+)/CD24(-) and ALDH1 high breast cancer stem cells  by threefold and twofold, respectively, and a reduction by 2.6-fold of the mammospheres formation. Nicastrin overexpression in nontransformed MCF10A cells caused an induction of epithelial to mesenchymal regulators, as well as a fivefold increased ALDH1 activity, a threefold enrichment for CD44(+)/CD24(-) stem cells, and a 3.2-fold enhanced mammosphere-forming capacity. Using the gamma-sescretase inhibiton, Notch1/4 siRNA, and Akt inhibition, we show that nicastrin regulates breast cancer stem cells partly through Notch1 and the Akt pathway. Exploiting serial dilution transplantation of the HCC1806 cells expressing nicastrin and HCC1806 stably depleted of nicastrin, in vivo, we demonstrate that nicastrin inhibition may be relevant for the reduced tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells.

We report here that microRNA-125a (miR-125a)-induced MPN display a complex manner of oncogene dependence. Following a gain-of-function genomics screen, we overexpressed candidate miR-125a in vivo, which led to phenotypes consistent with an atypical MPN characterized by leukocytosis, monocytosis, splenomegaly, and progressive anemia. The diseased MPN state could be recapitulated in a doxycycline-inducible  mouse model. Upon doxycycline withdrawal, the primary MPN phenotypes rapidly resolved after the discontinuation of miR-125a overexpression. However, reinduction of miR-125a led to complex phenotypes, with some animals rapidly developing lethal anemia with extensive damages in the spleen. Forced expression  of miR-125a resulted in elevated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and hypersensitivity toward hematopoietic cytokines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-125a targets multiple protein phosphatases.

Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles offer strong contrast-enhancing effect for MR imaging of pancreatic tissue. PURPOSE: To establish a biomarker-targeted nanoparticulate contrast agent CXCR4-USPIO for pancreatic cancer cell MR imaging and to investigate the relationship between in  vitro MR T2 enhancement ratio, DeltaR2 values, and the cellular CXCR4 expression  levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The CXCR4 monoclonal antibody and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were bioconjugated with USPIO using carbodiimide. The T2 and T2* values of CXCR4-USPIO, BSA-USPIO, and USPIO were evaluated at the same iron concentration levels. After incubating four pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, PANC-1) with CXCR4-USPIO and BSA-USPIO, respectively, changes of T2 values were measured with a clinical 1.5-T MRI scanner. Western blot and immunofluorescence tests were applied to semi-quantitatively analyze the expression levels of CXCR4 in the four cell lines. RESULTS: MR imaging revealed a linear correlation between DeltaR2 and DeltaR2* values of CXCR4-USPIO nanoparticles and the iron concentrations. The T2 enhancement ratio and DeltaR2 values of AsPC-1, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, PANC-1 cell lines in the CXCR4-USPIO group exhibited strong correlation with the CXCR4 peptide relative grey values measured by western blot (r = 0.976, P = 0.024; r = 0.959, P = 0.041, respectively) and the mean fluorescence signal intensity detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy (r = 0.996, P = 0.004; r = 0.962, P = 0.038, respectively). CONCLUSION: The targeted probe CXCR4-USPIO was created for MR molecular imaging of pancreatic cancer cell lines. The T2 enhancement ratio and DeltaR2 values of CXCR4-USPIO nanoparticles could semi-quantitatively assess the cellular CXCR4 expression levels.',\n",

This paper presents the results of potential clinicopathological predictors of axillary lymph node involvement and develops an efficient prediction model to assist in predicting axillary lymph node metastases. Seventy patients with primary early breast cancer who underwent axillary dissection were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to evaluate the association between clinicopathological factors and lymph node metastatic status. A logistic  regression predictive model was built from 50 randomly selected patients; the model was also applied to the remaining 20 patients to assess its validity. Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between lymph node involvement and absence of nm-23 (p = 0.010) and Kiss-1 (p = 0.001) expression. Absence of Kiss-1 remained significantly associated with positive axillary node status in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.018). Seven clinicopathological factors were involved in the multivariate logistic regression model: menopausal status, tumor size, ER, PR, HER2, nm-23 and Kiss-1. The model was accurate and discriminating, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.702 when applied to the validation group. Moreover, there is a need discover more specific candidate proteins and molecular biology tools to select more variables which should improve predictive accuracy.',\n",

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study within Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large integrated health care system. Men aged 35 years and older at baseline, in 1998, were eligible. The proportion of men who underwent PSA screening was estimated and compared across groups defined by patient and physician characteristics. We also evaluated trends in screening across time and  serum PSA levels for all subgroups. RESULTS: Of 2,061,047 men, 572,306 (28%) underwent PSA screening from 1998 through 2007. Patterns of PSA screening varied  modestly by age, race, and physician. The lowest frequencies of screening occurred among men younger than age 45 years (19%) and men ages 85 years and older (13%). PSA screening was most common among white men (33.5%) and in men seen by physicians of the same race/ethnicity (32%), compared with men with physicians of disparate race/ethnicity (26%, p < 0.001). PSA screening increased  over time for all racial/ethnic groups and among men age 75 years and older but decreased over time for men younger than age 75 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1  in 4 eligible men underwent PSA screening from 1998 through 2007, and screening varied only modestly by patient and physician characteristics. Estimates of the frequency of PSA screening in general-practice settings can inform the debate and provide useful insight as to how changes in cancer screening guidelines would alter practice patterns in an increasingly integrated health care environment.',\n",

If so, should therapeutics be developed to restore particular regulatory  pathways to cancer cells? These questions have been approached through mechanistic studies of a prototypical RTK, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR signaling is mediated and regulated by both signaling and trafficking effectors. The amplitude of receptor-proximal signals changes as EGFRs move along the degradative trafficking pathway from the cell surface, to endosomes, and into lysosomes. To optimize therapeutic suppression of receptor oncogenicity, it may be crucial to target EGFRs that are signaling from a specific site in the trafficking pathway. Research suggests that EGFRs at the plasma membrane produce the bulk of the global transcriptional response to EGF. EGFRs localized between the internalization and early endosome fusion stages of the pathway enrich the expression of transcripts associated with cancer. EGFRs at later trafficking checkpoints controlled by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes II and III do not contribute substantially to the EGFR-mediated transcriptional response. These results suggest that therapeutics targeting the receptors at the earliest stages of degradative trafficking might be most effective.',\n",

The impact of these high QA measures on patient experience and satisfaction is unknown. AIMS: To determine the impact of this high-level QA of colonoscopy on patient satisfaction. METHODS: A case controlled study using a retrospective audit & telephone interview patient survey was performed between 1/1/07-01/10/08 on patients that underwent colonoscopy. Data were analyzed by comparing quantitative and qualitative performance colonoscopy indicators in patients within the BCSP with those outside the programme (NON-BCSP). PARTICIPANTS: 720 patients that had undergone day case colonoscopy. SETTING: Accredited BCSP centre: University Hospitals Aintree, UK. INTERVENTION: Comparing patient satisfaction between BCSP to NON-BCSP populations. RESULTS: Uptake was 68% (n=488). Caecal intubation rate (CIR) was higher (99 v 91%; p=0.001), and sedation doses lower in BCSP compared to NON-BCSP (Midazolam dose Median [IQR] (1 [0, 2] v 2 [1, 3] mg; respectively p=0.0001). For patient satisfaction and experience, scores were high and pain scores were low in both groups; with no statistically significant difference between groups. However, willingness to have a repeat procedure was higher in BCSP (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst superior CIR with less sedation within BCSP, overall scores were similar for patient satisfaction, both in and outside the programme. With the higher 'willingness for repeat' within BCSP, a positive impact of higher level of QA is suggested and that good patient experience can be achieved with minimal conscious sedation in expert hands.\",\n",

METHODS: We studied patients with advanced BTC registered at the Department of Oncology at the Fundeni Clinical Institute between 2004 and 2008. The following data were analyzed: rate of response, progression free survival (PFS) to first and second line of chemotherapy, overall survival (OS) and drug toxicity. Ninety-six patients were eligible having either advanced intra or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, or gallbladder cancer with no prior chemotherapy. RESULTS: Out of 96 patients, 57 (59.4%) received fluoropyrimidines (FP)+cisplatin and 39 (40.6%) gemcitabine (Gem)+/-cisplatin. The median PFS for FP+cisplatin was 5.9 months (95%CI 5-6.9) and for Gem+/-cisplatin 6.3 months (95%CI 5.4-7.1), p=0.661. Median OS for FP+cisplatin was 10.3 months (95%CI 7.5-13.1) and for Gem+/-cisplatin 9.1 months (95%CI 7.0-11.2), p=0.098.

Here, we focused on ZEB1, epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-inducer, as a target gene of miR-150 based on in silico predictions. The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinicopathological significance of miR-150 in ESCC, and to investigate miR-150's EMT-regulatory ability. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate miR-150 expression in 108 curative resected ESCC samples to determine the clinicopathological significance. Moreover, we examined the in vitro and in vivo  function of miR-150 via degradation of ZEB1. MiR-150 expression was significantly lower in cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P < 0.001). Low expression of miR-150 in ESCC contributed to malignant potential, such as tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, clinical staging, and poor prognosis (P < 0.05). In vitro assays showed that EMT-inducer-ZEB1 is a new direct target of miR-150. Moreover, miR-150 induced MET-like changes in TE-8 cells through ZEB1 degradation (e.g., E-cadherin expression, vimentin repression, epithelial morphology, and suppression of migration ability), and significantly inhibited tumorigenicity and tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model.

Responsive multifunctional theranostic nanocarriers possessing external stimuli-tunable drug release rates and imaging signal intensities represent another promising direction in this field. In this work, we fabricated responsive amphiphilic diblock copolymer micelles exhibiting  light-triggered hydrophobic-hydrophilic transition within micellar cores and the  concomitant enhancement of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast performance and release rate of physically encapsulated hydrophobic drugs. POEGMA-b-P(NIPAM-co-NBA-co-Gd) diblock copolymer covalently labeled with Gd(3+) complex (Gd) in the light-responsive block was synthesized at first, where OEGMA, NIPAM, and NBA are oligo(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate, N-isopropylacrylamide, and o-nitrobenzyl acrylate, respectively. The amphiphilic  diblock copolymer spontaneously self-assembles in aqueous solution into micellar  nanoparticles possessing hydrophobic P(NIPAM-co-NBA-co-Gd) cores and hydrophilic  POEGMA coronas, which can physically encapsulate doxorubicin (Dox) as a model chemotherapeutic drug. Upon UV irradiation, hydrophobic NBA moieties within micellar cores transform into hydrophilic carboxyl derivatives, triggering micelle microstructural changes and core swelling. During this process, the microenvironment surrounding Gd(3+) complexes was subjected to a transition from  being hydrophobic to hydrophilic, leading to the enhancement of MR imaging contrast performance, that is, ~1.9-fold increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r(1)). In addition, the release rate of encapsulated Dox was also enhanced (~65% of Dox release in 12 h upon UV irradiation versus ~47% Dox release in 25 h for the control). The reported strategy of light-triggered coenhancement of MR imaging contrast performance and drug release profiles represents a general route to the construction of next generation smart polymeric theranostic nanocarriers.',\n",

Recent studies have revealed a function for SCD1 in the modulation of signaling processes related to cell proliferation, survival and transformation to cancer. We used MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to analyze the role of SCD1 in the metastatic acquisition of breast cancer cells. Silencing SCD1 expression in breast cancer cells has no effect on cell viability but the levels of cell proliferation, cell cycle genes' expressions and the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2 MAPK are significantly reduced. Decreasing SCD1 expression also reduces the level of GSK3 phosphorylation, indicating higher activity of the kinase. Using cells fractionation, immunofluorescence and a beta-catenin/TCF-responsive reporter construct, we demonstrate that lowering SCD1 expression leads to a decrease of beta-catenin amounts within the nucleus and to inhibition of its transactivation capacity. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the SCD1 siRNA show a lower invasive potential than the control cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that low SCD1 expression is associated with a decrease in the proliferation rate of breast cancer cells associated with a decrease in ERK1/2 activation. SCD1 silencing also inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation, lowering beta-catenin translocation to the nucleus, and, subsequently, its transactivation capacity and the expression of its target genes. Finally, we show that silencing  SCD1 impairs the epithelial to mesenchymal transition-like behavior of the cells, a characteristic of metastatic breast cancer.\",\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9, CA50 and CA72-4 in gastric cancer. METHODS: About  391 gastric cancer patients who underwent curative D2 gastrectomy between 2001 and 2006 were evaluated. The correlation between tumour markers and clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic value of preoperative tumour markers was investigated. RESULTS: Correlation analysis showed that AFP was associated with tumour size (P = 0.040); CEA with lymphatic invasion (P = 0.023)  and pathological stage (P = 0.018); CA19-9 with tumour size (P = 0.000), Borrmann type (P = 0.027), lymphatic invasion (P = 0.020) and pathological stage (P = 0.001); CA50 with lymphatic invasion (P = 0.004) and pathological stage (P = 0.004); CA72-4 with tumour size (P = 0.000), tumour size (P = 0.000) and Borrmann type (P = 0.008); lymphatic invasion (P = 0.000), nervous invasion (P = 0.028) and pathological stage (P = 0.000).

The objective of this study was to develop and pretest a thyroid cancer specific HRQoL questionnaire that can be used in addition to the more general European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Potentially relevant issues were identified by a systematic literature review, a focus group meeting,  and an issue list completed by six health care professionals (HCP) and 18 thyroid cancer survivors. Resultant issues were analyzed on importance and relevance (phase I). The issues were formulated into a long provisional list of questions (phase II). These questions were administered in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 306 Dutch thyroid cancer survivors to pretest the hypothesized scale structure (phase III). Although the development of this questionnaire was not set up as an international study, phases I-III are in agreement with the methodology  of the EORTC guidelines. RESULTS: The literature search, focus group and issue list completed by HCP and survivors resulted in 75 issues. These were reduced to  create a 30 item provisional list. Pretesting led to a selection of 24 items with a good range of response. This resulted in the THYCA-QoL containing 24 items and  seven conceptual scales.

Those that are available tend to be led by highly trained professionals, limiting their accessibility and long-term sustainability. In addition, it is recognised that patients who might benefit from conventional face-to-face psychosocial interventions do not access these, either by preference or because of geographical or mobility barriers. Self-directed interventions can overcome some  of these limitations and have been shown to contribute to patient well-being. This study will examine the feasibility of a self-directed, coping skills intervention for couples affected by cancer, called Coping-Together, and begin to explore its potential impact on couples' illness adjustment. The pilot version of Coping-Together includes a series of four booklets, a DVD, and a relaxation audio CD. METHODS/DESIGN: In this double-blind, two-group, parallel, randomized controlled trial, 70 couples will be recruited within 4 months of a prostate cancer diagnosis through urology private practices and randomized to: 1) Coping-Together or 2) a minimal ethical care condition. Minimal ethical care condition couples will be mailed information booklets available at the Cancer Council New South Wales and a brochure for the Cancer Council Helpline. The primary outcome (anxiety) and additional secondary outcomes (distress, depression, dyadic adjustment, quality of life, illness or caregiving appraisal,  self-efficacy, and dyadic and individual coping) will be assessed at baseline (before receiving study material) and 2 months post-baseline. Intention-to-treat  and per protocol analysis will be conducted. DISCUSSION: As partners' distress rates exceed not only population norms, but also those reported by patients themselves, it is imperative that coping skills interventions target the couple as a unit and enhance both partners' ability to overcome cancer challenges. This  pilot study will examine the feasibility and potential efficacy of Coping-Together in optimising couples' illness adjustment. This is one of the first feasibility studies to test this innovative coping intervention, which in turn will contribute to the larger literature advocating for psychosocial care of couples affected by prostate cancer.

Melatonin reduces estrogen biosynthesis in human breast cancer cells, surrounding fibroblasts and peritumoral endothelial cells by regulating cytokines that influence tumor microenvironment. This hormone also exerts antiangiogenic activity in tumoral tissue. In this work, our objective was to study the role of melatonin on the regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in breast cancer cells. To accomplish this, we cocultured human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). VEGF added to the cultures stimulated the proliferation of HUVECs and melatonin (1 mM) counteracted this effect. Melatonin reduced VEGF production and  VEGF mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells cocultured with HUVECs stimulated the endothelial cells proliferation and increased VEGF levels in the culture media. Melatonin counteracted both stimulatory effects on HUVECs proliferation and on VEGF protein levels in the coculture media. Conditioned media from MCF-7 cells increased HUVECs proliferation, and this effect was significantly counteracted by anti-VEGF and 1 mM melatonin. All these findings suggest that melatonin may play a role in the paracrine interactions between malignant epithelial cells and proximal endothelial cells through a downregulatory action on VEGF expression in human breast cancer cells, which decrease the levels of VEGF around endothelial cells. Lower levels of VEGF could  be important in reducing the number of estrogen-producing cells proximal to malignant cells as well as decreasing tumoral angiogenesis.',\n",

Rasburicase reduces PUA levels within 4 hours of administration, thereby minimizing the risk of serious complications from TLS. Treatment pattern analyses indicate rasburicase is often used in combination with allopurinol; however, no studies have evaluated the clinical and economic consequences of this pattern of  care. The purpose of this study was to compare hospitalization costs, overall length of stay (LOS), and critical-care LOS in patients receiving rasburicase with or without allopurinol. METHODS: Hospital claims data from the Premier Perspective Database were used to conduct this retrospective analysis. Patients in the Premier hospital database who were administered rasburicase or combination therapy (rasburicase + allopurinol) within 2 days of hospital admission were eligible for study inclusion. Patients were excluded if they were <18 years of age or received haemodialysis (or any other renal replacement therapy support) on admission. Rasburicase patients were propensity-score-matched to combination therapy patients based on gender, race, hospital type (urban/rural, teaching), provider type, payer type, admission source, use of electrolyte modification therapy, critical-care admission and presence of a cancer diagnosis. Differences  in healthcare costs, overall LOS and critical-care LOS were assessed using gamma-distributed generalized linear models with a log-link function. RESULTS: The study population comprised 66 patients receiving rasburicase monotherapy matched to 66 patients receiving combination therapy. Mean age was 62.9 years, and 29% were female. Patients initiated on combination therapy had a shorter mean duration of rasburicase administration than patients initiated on monotherapy (2.1 vs 2.7 days) [p = 0.0059]. Additionally, rasburicase monotherapy incurred an average total cost of $US35 843 per hospitalization, compared with $US46 672 for  those receiving combination therapy (p = 0.0820). Rasburicase monotherapy patients also had a shorter mean overall LOS (10.0 days vs 15.4 days; p = 0.0067). The mean critical-care LOS was similar in both cohorts (2.4 days rasburicase vs 2.9 days combination therapy; p = 0.3389). CONCLUSION: Examination of claims data showed that combination therapy (rasburicase + allopurinol) trended toward higher total hospitalization costs than rasburicase monotherapy.

Here, we characterize miR-101 expression and its role in the regulation of COX-2 expression, which in turn, will provide us with additional insights into the potential therapeutic benefits  of exogenous miR-101 for treatment of gastric cancer. Our results showed that miR-101 levels in gastric cancer tissues were significantly lower than those in the matched normal tissue (P < 0.01). Furthermore, lower levels of miR-101 were associated with increased tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). We also found an inverse correlation between miR-101 and COX-2 expression in both gastric cancer specimens and cell lines. Significant decreases in COX-2 mRNA and  COX-2 levels were observed in the pre-miR-101-infected gastric cancer cells. One  possible mechanism of interaction is that miR-101 inhibited COX-2 expression by directly binding to the 3'-UTR of COX-2 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-101 in gastric cancer cell lines also inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro, as well as inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. These results collectively  indicate that miR-101 may function as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, with  COX-2 as a direct target.\",\n",

Synthetic hydrogels provide the flexibility to design three-dimensional (3D) matrices to isolate and study individual factors in the tumor microenvironment. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect  of matrix modulus on tumorsphere formation by breast cancer cells and maintenance of CSCs in an inert microenvironment without the interference of other factors. In that regard, 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells were encapsulated in inert polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogels and the effect of matrix modulus on tumorsphere formation and expression of CSC markers was investigated. The gel modulus had a strong effect on tumorsphere formation and the effect was bimodal.  Tumorsphere formation and expression of CSC markers peaked after 8 days of culture. At day 8, as the matrix modulus was increased from 2.5 kPa to 5.3, 26.1, and 47.1 kPa, the average tumorsphere size changed from 37+/-6 mum to 57+/-6, 20+/-4, and 12+/-2 mum, respectively; cell number density in the gel changed from 0.8+/-0.1x10(5) cells/mL to 1.7+/-0.2x10(5), 0.4+/-0.1x10(5), and 0.2+/-0.1x10(5) cells/mL after initial encapsulation of 0.14x10(5) cells/mL; and the expression of CD44 breast CSC marker changed from 17+/-4-fold to 38+/-9-, 3+/-1-, and 2+/-1-fold increase compared with the initial level. Similar results were obtained with MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells. Mouse 4T1 and human MCF7 cells encapsulated in the gel with 5.3 kPa modulus formed the largest tumorspheres and  highest density of tumorspheres, and had highest expression of breast CSC markers CD44 and ABCG2.

Inhibiting COX may therefore have anti-carcinogenic effects. Results from use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibiting only COX have been conflicting. It has been postulated that this might result from the shunting of arachidonic acid metabolism to the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway. Cancer cell viability is promoted by 5-LOX through several mechanisms that are similar to those of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Expression of 5-LOX is upregulated in colorectal adenoma and cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the shunting of arachidonic acid metabolism to the 5-LOX pathway by cyclooxygenase inhibition and to determine if this process antagonizes the anti-cancer effect in colorectal cancer cells. METHODS: Three colorectal cancer cell lines (HCA7, HT-29 & LoVo) expressing 5-LOX and different levels of COX-2 expression were used. The effects  of aspirin (a non-selective COX inhibitor) and rofecoxib (COX-2 selective) on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) secretion were quantified by ELISA. Proliferation and viability were studied by quantifying double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) content and metabolic activity. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V and propidium iodide staining using confocal microscopy, and caspase-3/7 activity by fluorescent substrate assay. RESULTS: COX inhibitors suppressed PGE2 production but enhanced LTB4 secretion in COX-2 expressing cell lines (P <0.001). The level of COX-2 expression in colorectal cancer cells did not significantly influence the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of COX inhibitors due  to the shunting mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of shunting  between COX and 5-LOX pathways in the presence of unilateral inhibition, and may  explain the conflicting anti-carcinogenic effects reported with use of COX inhibitors.',\n",

       " '23013489': {'AB': 'BACKGROUND: There has been substantial increase in use of androgen deprivation therapy as adjuvant management of prostate cancer. However, this leads to a range of musculoskeletal toxicities including reduced bone mass and increased skeletal  fractures compounded with rapid metabolic alterations, including increased body fat, reduced lean mass, insulin resistance and negative lipoprotein profile, increased incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity, greater distress and reduced quality of life. Numerous research studies have demonstrated certain  exercise prescriptions to be effective at preventing or even reversing these treatment toxicities. However, all interventions to date have been of rehabilitative intent being implemented after a minimum of 3 months since initiation of androgen deprivation, by which time considerable physical and psychological health problems have manifested. The pressing question is whether it is more efficacious to commence exercise therapy at the same time as initiating androgen deprivation, so treatment induced adverse effects can be immediately attenuated or indeed prevented. METHODS/DESIGN: We are proposing a multi-site randomized controlled trial with partial crossover to examine the effects of timing of exercise implementation (immediate or delayed) on preserving long-term skeletal health, reversing short- and long-term metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, and supporting mental health in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy. 124 men who are about to initiate androgen deprivation for prostate cancer will be randomized to immediate or delayed groups. Immediate will commence a 6-month exercise program within 7-10 days of their first dose. Delayed will receive usual care for 6 months and then commence  the exercise program for 6 months (partial cross-over). Immediate will be free to adopt the lifestyle of their choosing following the initial 6-month intervention. Measurements for primary and secondary endpoints will take place at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. DISCUSSION: This project is unique as it explores a fundamental question of when exercise implementation will be of most benefit and  addresses both physical and psychological consequences of androgen deprivation initiation. The final outcome may be adjunct treatment which will reduce if not prevent the toxicities of androgen deprivation, ultimately resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality for men with prostate cancer.

Polymorphisms present in  these genes could lead to changes in their metabolizing and detoxifying ability and thus may contribute to individual susceptibility to different types of cancer. We investigated if the individual and/or combined modifying effects of the CYP1A1 MspI T6235C, GSTM1 present/null, GSTT1 present/null and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphisms are related to the risk of developing lung cancer in relation to tobacco consumption and occupation in Asturias, Northern Spain. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study (CAPUA Study) was designed including 789 lung cancer patients and 789 control subjects matched in ethnicity, age, sex, and hospital. Genotypes were determined by PCR or PCR-RFLP. Individual and combination effects were analysed using an unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, pack-years, family history of any cancer and occupation. RESULTS: No statistically significant main effects were observed for the carcinogen metabolism genes in relation to lung cancer risk. In addition, the analysis did not reveal any significant gene-gene, gene-tobacco smoking or gene-occupational exposure interactions relative to lung cancer susceptibility. Lastly, no significant gene-gene combination effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS:  These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms in the CYP1A1, GSTM1, GSTT1 and  GSTP1 metabolic genes were not significantly associated with lung cancer risk in  the current study. The results of the analysis of gene-gene interactions of CYP1A1 MspI T6235C, GSTM1 present/null, GSTT1 present/null and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphisms in lung cancer risk indicate that these genes do not interact in lung cancer development.',\n",

The main purpose of the study therefore was to determine whether family-related factors predict PTG above and beyond demographic variables and coping related processes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included  190 women, breast-cancer patients, aged 31 to 83 years.

Post traumatic growth index, FACES-IV - family relationships scale, coping response inventory, demographic, and illness-related questionnaires were administered after informed  consent was obtained. The PTG index was used as an outcome measure. RESULTS: Congruent with previous findings, analyses yielded weak correlations between demographic- and illness-related variables, and PTG. Also congruent with previous findings, approach related coping strategies were found to predict PTG, R squared =0.16, p<0.001. In addition to previous findings, family related factors predicted unique proportion of variance on PTG, p<0.05, with communication having positive and satisfaction negative load on PTG.

PET and PET/CT using [11C]- and [18F]-labelled choline derivates are increasingly being used for imaging primary and recurrent prostate  cancer. The value of [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer has been evaluated in many studies and  shows an increasing importance. Morphological imaging techniques such as TRUS, CT and MRI (including functional imaging tools) have shown only limited accuracy for the diagnosis of primary prostate cancer. Molecular imaging techniques such as PET and PET/CT may improve the detection rate and localization of primary prostate cancer. The potential of PET/CT using [11C]- and [18F]-labelled choline  derivates for the diagnosis of primary prostate cancer has been assessed in a lot of studies with partly controversial results. [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT demonstrated moderate sensitivity for the detection of primary prostate cancer, which depends on the tumour configuration. Furthermore the detection rate is limited by a considerable number of microcarcinomas that can often not be visualized due to partial volume effects. Therefore small and in part rind-like tumours can often not be detected. Additionally, specificity of [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT is limited as differentiation between benign prostatic changes like prostatitis, prostatic hyperplasia and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is not always possible. At the present time, the routine use of PET/CT with [11C]- and [18F]-labelled choline derivates can not be recommended as a first-line screening procedure for primary prostate cancer in men at risk. However, choline PET and PET/CT may be useful in preparation of a focused re-biopsy in patients suffering from clinically suspected prostate cancer with repeatedly negative prostate biopsies. In the future [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT may also be helpful in patient stratification with respect to primary surgery and radiation therapy.',\n",

The availability of dedicated PET/CT scanners allows fusioning of morphological and functional images, which enables accurate localization of sites of pathological tracer uptake and ease the differentiation between malignant and benign findings. A noteworthy advantage of this whole-body technique is that it provides information on multiple anatomic sites at a single time. As such, the technique has the capability of distinguishing between local relapse and distant  metastases, and therefore has the potential to guide the medical treatment. The positive detection rate of [11C]choline PET/CT varies substantially in relation to the inclusion criteria. Studies which included unselected consecutive patients reported a positive detection rate ranging between 40% and 70%. Serum PSA level represents the single, most important factor affecting the rate of positive scans. Other positive predicitive factors include fast PSA kinetics (PSA velocity, PSA doubling time), advanced pathological state at initial staging, previous biochemical failure, hormone resistance and older age. Recent studies indicate that [11C]choline PET/CT has the potential to early restaging PCa patients for PSA levels lower than 1-1.5 ng/mL. However, more studies are necessary to better define the potential of this technique for low PSA levels. The previously cited risk factors can be used to identify patients that are at greater risk and that might best benefit from PET/CT scans. Patients that develop biochemical failure during androgen deprivation therapy (hormone resistance) have a higher likelihood for a positive [11C]choline PET/CT scan in comparison to patients that are drug naive (hormone sensitive) and are not required to withdraw the anti-androgenic treatment before PET/CT.',\n",

PET in conjunction with 18F-FLT or 18F-FMAU that track the thymidine salvage pathway of  DNA synthesis has also been investigated for imaging cellular proliferation in prostate cancer.

METHODS: We retrospectively studied 190 patients (187 women and 3 men, mean age 61+/-11 years) with previous  BC (all stages) after surgery and other primary treatments. They underwent within three months CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations for the evaluation of disease status. Disease relapse was confirmed by clinical evaluation and/or radiological  findings. Survival curves of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were computed using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox analysis regression was used to determine predictive factors of DFS and OS. RESULTS: Of the overall 190 patients, 82 (43%) had evidence of clinical and/or imaging disease relapse, while 108 (57%) did not. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive and positive predictive values for disease relapse or progression were of 89% vs. 77%, 73% vs. 53%, 90% vs. 75% and 72% vs. 55%, respectively for PET/CT and CT. DFS curves were significantly different in patients with both negative and positive PET/CT and CT (log-rank test 33.6; P<0.0001 and 12.7; P=0.003, respectively). OS curves were similar in patients with positive/negative PET/CT and CT (P=NS). By both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis positive PET/CT was found to  be related to the disease recurrence (HR 0.18 and 0.20, both P<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: PET/CT is more accurate than CT in identification of disease relapse in a large population of BC patients. In women at high-risk of recurrence, PET/CT imaging can provide the early detection of BC metastases, tailoring a proper treatment.',\n",

With no intervention, 40%-90% of these infants will acquire hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Approximately 90% of infected infants develop chronic HBV infection, with a 15%-25% risk for premature death from cirrhosis or cancer of the liver. To prevent perinatal HBV transmission, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that infants born to HBsAg-positive women receive postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth, and complete the 3-dose HepB series. To determine infant outcomes after postexposure prophylaxis, ACIP recommends postvaccination serologic testing (PVST) at age 9-18 months. To evaluate the implementation of these recommendations, CDC assessed outcomes at age 24 months (through 2011) among infants born to HBsAg-positive women enrolled during 2008-2009 in Enhanced Perinatal Hepatitis B Case Management Projects (EPHBP). Of  4,214 EPHBP-managed infants who completed >/=3 HepB doses, 63.7% had reported PVST results, 13.3% had reported PVST results but infant age was unknown, and 23.0% had no reported PVST results. Of 2,683 infants with PVST results by age 24  months, 93.3% were protected, 1.2% were infected, 3.2% remained susceptible, and  2.3% had indeterminate results. ACIP-recommended postexposure prophylaxis was highly effective among infants who completed vaccination and received PVST. PVST  is critical for guiding medical management of infants born to HBsAg-positive women, identifying infants with HBV infection and in need of further care, and monitoring progress toward the elimination of perinatal HBV transmission.',\n",

MATERIALS/METHODS: Normal ovarian surface epithelium tissues (n = 13), ovarian cancer tissues (n = 28), ovarian cancer cell lines, and a 3-dimensional model of fibrillar type I collagen that mimicked pathological ECM in vivo were used in the study. We explored the specific mechanisms behind ECM remodeling and the cellular signals that affected the invasion of ovarian cancer cells. RESULTS: The data showed that increased beta1 integrin expression in ovarian cancer cells led to enhance migration/invasion of ovarian cancer cells via regulation of PTEN/protein kinase  B (Akt) signal in response to fibrillar type I collagen matrices. Low PTEN activity corresponded to the following: (1) increased PTEN degradation and (2) phosphorylation of PTEN. Decreased protein phosphatase 2A activity was detected in ovarian cancer. Protein phosphatase 2A might play a role in enhancing the progression of ovarian cancer through regulating PTEN/Akt signal. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that fibrillar type I collagen, by modulating integrin-PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in remodeling ECM, is very important in  affecting the invasion of aggressive ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, these data provide direct evidence for pathological ECM remodeling and cell signaling networks involved in the invasion of ovarian cancer cells.',\n",

METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer from a large urban hospital were identified through medical records, and representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor blocks were retrieved. The study sample included 150 patients (84 African Americans) who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy for endometrial cancer. The Sequenom MassARRAY system and the OncoCarta Assay version 1.0 (Sequenom) were used to test for 238 mutations in 19 common oncogenes. The chi(2) test and the Fisher exact test were used to assess differences in distribution of variables by race and oncogene mutation status. RESULTS: There were 20 mutations identified in 2 oncogenes (PIK3CA and KRAS) in tumors from 19 women (12.7%). Most of the mutations were found in PIK3CA (16/20). Thirteen percent of endometrioid tumors harbored mutations (11 PIK3CA and 2 KRAS) as did 29% of the malignant mixed Mullerian tumors (3 PIK3CA and 1 KRAS). There were no  observed mutations in serous, clear cell, or mucinous tumor types. Among low-grade endometrioid cancers, tumors from African American patients were significantly associated with harboring either a KRAS or PIK3CA mutation (P = 0.04), with 7 PIK3CA mutations and all 4 KRAS mutations identified in African American women. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that oncogene mutation frequency of some subtypes of histologically similar endometrial carcinoma differ by race.

METHODS: A series of  133 patients who had a diagnosis of VSCC (1983-2008) was selected for the study.  Detection of 11 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and  59) and 2 low-risk HPV types (6 and 11) was performed with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Samples positive for HPV 16 were further analyzed for variant determination of 7 positions in the E6 gene with polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Forty (30.8%) of 130 tumors were found to be HPV positive. Human papillomavirus type 16 was found in 31 cases, HPV 18 was found in 2 cases, HPV 33 was found in 5 cases, and HPV 56 and HPV 59 were found in one case each. All but one tumor harboring HPV 16 were of European linage, and the 3  most common variants were E-p (n = 13), E-G350 (n = 7), and E-G131 (n = 5). HPV positivity was associated with the basaloid tumor type and occurred in significantly younger patients. Overall and recurrence-free survival rates were better in HPV-positive cases, but after correction for age and tumor size, HPV status was no longer an independent and significant prognostic factor. The survival rates of the various HPV 16 variants were not significantly different, but there was a trend of worse outcome for the E-G131-variant group. CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus positivity of 30.8% is similar to other reports on VSCC. To  our knowledge, this first variant determination of HPV 16 in vulvar carcinoma in  a Swedish cohort indicated that the variant E-G131 may have an increased oncogenic potential in patients with VSCC.',\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: average annual population of the cities under study in 2003-2008 was 439 600 persons. Total and specific cancer incidence was investigated. Site specific incidence was analyzed for malignancies proved to be  radiosensitive in previous studies: trachea, bronchus and lung, breast, kidney, thyroid cancer and leukemia. Data on cancer cases were received in National Cancer Registry of Ukraine (National Cancer Institute). There was used the data of the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine on the size of the studied population by gender - age groups. Standardized incidence ratio of cancer at a whole and for each of five specific forms of malignancies were calculated for the population of each city and group of cities depending on the nature of industrial activity. RESULTS: During the observed period there were registered 9 381 cancer  cases in inhabitants of Ukrainian cities with radiation hazardous facilities. There was stated that cancer incidence rate in population of 5 cities significantly exceeded national and regional levels. Among specific forms of malignancy there were observed excess of lung, trachea, bronchus, breast, kidney  cancer and leukemia in population of extractive, processing uranium ore cities. No excess of thyroid cancer was identified. In cities with nuclear power station  there were registered excess of kidney cancer. CONCLUSION: Results of the study suggest the necessity to explore the role of various factors in forming the identified cancer incidence features in the Ukrainian population living near the  nuclear power facilities.',\n",

For G2 assay lymphocytes were irradiated with 0,5 Gy of X-rays after 47 h of incubation. RESULTS: Significant differences in mean scores both of G0 and G2 assay between breast cancer patients and controls were observed indicating the increased chromosomal radiosensitivity of lymphocytes of cancer patients. 11% of healthy women and 38% of BC patients were determined to be radiosensitive with G2 assay.

We report a case  of metastatic lesion in the thyroid from breast carcinoma which was recognized in a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and confirmed by immunohistopathology. In addition, we provide an overview of the literature describing similar cases. STUDY DESIGN: The patient was a 54-year old woman with a large, multinodular goiter and bilaterally enlarged lymph nodes in the supraclavicular areas. Fourteen years earlier she had undergone radical mastectomy followed by chemio- and radiotherapy due to a breast carcinoma. RESULTS: FNA of the thyroid nodules showed a metastatic breast carcinoma and was followed by total strumectomy and lymphadenectomy. Histological reassessment of the surgical thyroid specimens as well as the neck lymph nodes revealed multiple breast metastases. This was strongly confirmed by immunohistochemical examinations, which revealed a positive staining for: CKMNF 116, CK7, CEA as well as for ER, PgR and HER2, and a negative staining for: CK20, thyroglobulin, TTF1, calcitonin, and chromogranin. CONCLUSION: Every new aggregate in the thyroid in patients with even a long-term  history of cancer should be considered as potentially metastatic until proved otherwise.

METHODS: Biopsies of the rectus abdominis muscle were obtained intra operatively from 102 gastric cancer patients and 29 subjects undergoing surgery for benign abdominal diseases, and muscle TRAF6 and ubiquitin mRNA expression and proteasome proteolytic activities were assessed. RESULTS: TRAF6 was significantly upregulated in muscle of gastric cancer compared with the control muscles. TRAF6  was upregulated in 67.65% (69/102) muscle of gastric cancer. Over expression of TRAF6 in muscles of gastric cancer were associated with TNM stage, level of serum albumin and percent of weight loss. Ubiquitin was significantly upregulated in muscle of gastric cancer compared with the control muscles. Ubiquitin was upregulated in 58.82% (60/102) muscles of gastric cancer. Over expression of ubiquitin in muscles of gastric cancer were associated with TNM (Tumor-Node-Metastasis) stage and weight loss. There was significant relation between TRAF6 and ubiquitin expression.

METHODS: Three light-cured sealants (Denton Clear, Delton Opaque, Ultraseal XT Plus) were applied in polyethylene molds (O:10mm, h:2mm, n:8) and photopolymerized (40 seconds, halogen bulb unit, standard mode 650 mW/cm 2 intensity). All specimens were immersed in normal saline for 1 week at 37 degrees C. Samples of eluents at concentrations of 5% and 10% (volume per volume) were tested for estrogenicity by measuring their effect on the proliferation of the estrogen responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In addition, an estrogen insensitive cell line was used as a control (MDA-MB-231) to exclude a possible cytostatic effect of the tested materials. All assays were repeated 4 times, and  results analyzed with a 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test at the 0.05 level. RESULTS: Eluents of the sealants tested at concentrations of 5% and 10% did not possess estrogenicity, except for the eluent of one sealant (Delton Opaque) at concentration 10%, which caused an induction of the proliferation rate of the MCF-7 cells.

RECENT FINDINGS: Hematologic malignancies are associated with a high risk of thrombotic complications. The incidence of these events is greatly variable and is influenced by many factors, including the type and the stage of disease, antitumor therapies, and the use of central venous device (CVD). Epidemiological  data allow an estimate of the incidence of VTE in acute leukemia, lymphomas, and  multiple myeloma. The effect of chemotherapy on the incidence of thrombosis is particularly evident in acute leukemia as it causes the exacerbation of the clotting/bleeding syndrome typical of this disease. The role of chemotherapy is also relevant in lymphoma, and in multiple myeloma, in which the use of immunomodulating agents, in combination with chemotherapy and steroids significantly increases the risk of VTE. SUMMARY: Thrombotic complications have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality of hematological cancer patients, therefore, in this setting, the issue of thromboprophylaxis to prevent VTE is important. However, no clear recommendation in these conditions is available, with the exception of multiple myeloma. Large prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the best practice for prevention and treatment of  VTE in these types of malignant diseases.',\n",

In this review, we will describe the different  sequencing technologies and platforms, and summarize the main findings from the latest sequencing articles in breast cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Firstly, the sequencing of a few hundreds of breast tumors has revealed new cancer genes. Although these were not frequently mutated, mutated genes from different patients could be grouped into the deregulation of similar pathways. Secondly, NGS allowed further exploration of intratumor heterogeneity and revealed that although subclonal mutations were present in all tumors, there was always a dominant clone, which comprised at least 50% of the tumor cells. Finally, tumor-specific DNA rearrangements could be detected in the patient's plasma, suggesting that NGS could be used to personalize the monitoring of the disease. SUMMARY: The application of NGS to breast cancer has been associated with tremendous advances  and promises for increasing the understanding of the disease. However, there still remain many unanswered questions, such as the role of structural changes of tumor genomes in cancer progression and treatment response/resistance.\",\n",

In addition, we systematically characterized the responses of a series  of TIL products to relevant autologous short term-cultured melanoma cell lines from 12 patients. We provide evidence that antitumor reactivity of both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells could be enhanced in most TIL products by autologous melanoma  sensitization by pretreatment with low-dose IFN-gamma.

VAA-I has shown some promising treatment results in some types of tumor cell lines, especially SMMC-7721 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cells). However, few details are  known about the mechanism and process of cell death induced by VAA-I in tumor cells. In this study, the cell morphology results showed that SMMC-7721 cells treated with VAA-I exhibited several features typical of apoptotic cell death, which was confirmed by the Caspase inhibition assay. Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) fluorescence imaging techniques showed that rVAA-I significantly elevated the intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i) in SMMC-7721 cells. These findings suggest that apoptosis may play the most important role in SMMC-7721 cell death induced by rVAA-I. Finally, in the SMMC-7721 cells treated with rVAA-I, a series  of genes in the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were expressed differentially, and further found that PI 3-kinase pathway is involved in rVAA-I signal transduction in SMMC-7721 cells.',\n",

As identification of LOH on cell-free DNA is impeded by the prevalence of wild type DNA in blood of cancer patients, we fractionated plasma DNA, and determined the diagnostic and prognostic value of both fractions. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Our cohort of 388 patients with primary breast cancer before chemotherapy was selected from a multicenter study (SUCCESS). Postoperative plasma was fractionated in low- and high-molecular weight DNA by two different column systems. In both fractions, LOH was determined by a PCR-based microsatellite analysis using a panel of 8 polymorphic markers. Circulating tumor DNA in plasma  from 30 patients after chemotherapy was additionally analyzed. The significance levels were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: More patients (38%) had LOH at all markers in the fraction containing short DNA fragments than in the fraction containing the long DNA molecules (28%, P = 0.0001). In both fractions 32.85% of LOH were concordant. LOH at the markers D3S1605, D10S1765, D12S1725, D13S218, and D17S855 significantly correlated with tumor stage, tumor size, and lymph node metastasis, positive progesterone, and HER2 receptor status. Most importantly, LOH at D12S1725 mapping to cyclin D2 correlated with shorter overall survival (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The improved detection of LOH on cell-free DNA provides important information on DNA losses of tumor suppressor genes TIG1, PTEN, cyclin D2, RB1, and BRCA1 in breast cancer. In particular, loss of the cyclin D2 gene might become an important prognostic marker easily detectable in the peripheral blood.',\n",

Phenotyping and genotyping of CTC may permit \"real-time\" treatment decisions, provided CTCs are available for examination. Here, we investigate what is needed to detect CTC in all patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CTCs enumerated in 7.5 mL of blood together with survival from 836 patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer were used to predict the CTC concentration in the 42% of these patients in whom no CTCs were found and to establish the relation of concentration of CTCs with survival. Influence of different CTC definitions were investigated by automated cell recognition and a flow cytometric assay without an enrichment or permeabilization step. RESULTS: A log-logistic regression of the log of CTC yielded a good fit to  the CTC frequency distribution. Extrapolation of the blood volume to 5 L predicted that 99% of patients had at least one CTC before therapy initiation. Survival of patients with EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, CD45- nucleated CTCs is reduced by 6.6 months for each 10-fold CTC increase. Using flow cytometry, the potential  three-fold recovery improvement is not sufficient to detect CTC in all patients in 7.5 mL of blood. CONCLUSIONS: EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, CD45- nucleated CTCs are present in all patients with metastatic breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and their frequency is proportional to survival.

To examine NK cell levels in archived bloods from a study of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a new DNA-based quantification method was developed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: NK cell-specific DNA methylation was identified by analyzing DNA methylation and mRNA array data from  purified blood leukocyte subtypes (NK, T, B, monocytes, granulocytes), and confirmed via pyrosequencing and quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP). NK cell levels in archived whole blood DNA from 122 HNSCC patients and 122 controls  were assessed by qMSP. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing and qMSP confirmed that a demethylated DNA region in NKp46 distinguishes NK cells from other leukocytes, and serves as a quantitative NK cell marker. Demethylation of NKp46 was significantly lower in HNSCC patient bloods compared with controls (P < 0.001). Individuals in the lowest NK tertile had over 5-fold risk of being a HNSCC case,  controlling for age, gender, HPV16 status, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI (OR = 5.6, 95% CI, 2.0 to 17.4). Cases did not show differences in NKp46 demethylation based on tumor site or stage. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate a significant depression in NK cells in HNSCC patients that is unrelated to exposures associated with the disease.

We  investigated whether early everolimus treatment effects could be monitored by positron emission tomography (PET) with (89)Zr-bevacizumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:  The effect of everolimus on VEGF-A secretion was determined in a panel of human ovarian cancer cell lines and in A2780(luc+) ovarian cancer cells xenografted subcutaneously in BALB/c mice. Mice received daily 10 mg/kg everolimus intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 14 days. PET scans with the tracer (89)Zr-labeled bevacizumab were conducted before and after treatment. Ex vivo (89)Zr-bevacizumab biodistribution and correlative tissue analyses were conducted. Tumor VEGF-A levels were measured with ELISA and mean vascular density (MVD) was determined with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Everolimus treatment reduced VEGF-A levels in the supernatant of all cell lines. Everolimus lowered (89)Zr-bevacizumab tumor uptake by 21.7% +/- 4.0% [mean standardized uptake value (SUV(mean)) 2.3 +/- 0.2  vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2, P < 0.01]. Ex vivo biodistribution also showed lower tracer uptake in the tumors of treated as compared with control animals (7.8 +/- 0.8%ID/g vs. 14.0 +/- 1.7%ID/g, P < 0.01), whereas no differences were observed for other tissues. This coincided with lower VEGF-A protein levels in tumor lysates in treated versus untreated tumors (P = 0.04) and reduced MVD (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Tumor VEGF-A levels are decreased by everolimus. (89)Zr-bevacizumab PET could be used to monitor tumor VEGF-A levels as an early biomarker of the antiangiogenic effect of mTOR inhibitor therapy.',\n",

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We genotyped 3,026 lung adenocarcinomas for the major EGFR (exon 19 deletions and L858R) and KRAS (G12, G13) mutations and examined correlations with demographic, clinical, and smoking  history data. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were found in 43% of never smokers and in 11% of smokers. KRAS mutations occurred in 34% of smokers and in 6% of never smokers. In patients with smoking histories up to 10 pack-years, EGFR predominated over KRAS. Among former smokers with lung cancer, multivariate analysis showed that, independent of pack-years, increasing smoking-free years raise the likelihood of EGFR mutation. Never smokers were more likely than smokers to have KRAS G > A transition mutation (mostly G12D; 58% vs. 20%, P = 0.0001). KRAS G12C, the most common G > T transversion mutation in smokers, was more frequent in women (P = 0.007) and these women were younger than men with the same mutation (median 65 vs. 69, P = 0.0008) and had smoked less. CONCLUSIONS: The distinct types of KRAS mutations in smokers versus never smokers suggest that most KRAS-mutant lung cancers in never smokers are not due to second-hand smoke exposure. The higher frequency of KRAS G12C in women, their younger age, and lesser smoking history together support a heightened susceptibility to tobacco carcinogens.',\n",

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced, solid tumors received escalating doses of oral AEE788 once daily. Primary endpoints were to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). A nonlinear model (Emax model) was used to describe the relationship between AEE788 exposure  and target-pathway modulation in skin and tumor tissues. RESULTS: Overall, 111 patients were treated (25 to 550 mg/day). DLTs included rash and diarrhea; MTD was 450 mg/day. Effects on biomarkers correlated to serum AEE788 concentrations.  The concentration at 50% inhibition (IC(50)) for EGFR in skin (0.033 mumol/L) and tumor (0.0125 mumol/L) were similar to IC(50) in vitro suggesting skin may be surrogate tissue for estimating tumor EGFR inhibition. No inhibition of p-MAPK and Ki67 was observed in skin vessels at </= MTD. Hence, AEE788 inhibited EGFR, but not VEGFR, at doses </= MTD. A total of 16 of 96 evaluable patients showed a  >10% shrinkage of tumor size; one partial response was observed. CONCLUSION: Our  pharmacodynamic-based study showed effective inhibition of EGFR, but not of VEGFR at tolerable AEE788 doses.

However, a replication-incompetent hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ; Sendai virus) envelope (HVJ-E) suppresses the growth of human cancer cells as effectively as replication-competent live HVJ without producing toxic effects in nonmalignant cells. Here, we analyze the molecular mechanism of the oncolytic activity of HVJ-E. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The  molecules responsible for HVJ-E-induced cancer cell death were elucidated in prostate cancer cell lines, and the effect of HVJ-E on orthotopic prostate cancers was evaluated in nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice. RESULTS: The liposome-mediated transfer of viral RNA genome fragments from HVJ-E suppressed the viability of prostate cancer cells but not the viability of the noncancerous prostate epithelium. Knockdown experiments using siRNAs showed that the cancer cell-selective killing induced by HVJ-E was mediated by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Downstream of the RIG-I/MAVS pathway, both TNF-related  apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Noxa were upregulated by HVJ-E in the castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line PC3 but not in the noncancerous prostate epithelial cell line PNT2. TRAIL siRNA but not Noxa siRNA significantly  inhibited HVJ-E-induced cell death in PC3 cells. However, Noxa siRNA effectively  suppressed HVJ-E-induced cell death in DU145 cells, another castration-resistant  prostate cancer cell line, in which Noxa but not TRAIL was upregulated by HVJ-E.  Furthermore, the orthotopic prostate cancers were dramatically eradicated in immunodeficient mice injected with HVJ-E.

Natural killer (NK) cell therapy is a potential treatment, but leukemia cells may be resistant. Here, we sought to determine the susceptibility  of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells to NK cell lysis and to develop a novel immunotherapeutic approach to optimize NK cell therapy, including the use of an antibody against leukemia-associated antigen and the elimination of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-mediated inhibition. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines (RS4;11, SEM, and MV4-11) and primary leukemia blasts were assessed for surface phenotype and susceptibility to NK cell lysis with or without antibodies against CD19 (XmAb5574), CD33 (lintuzumab), or KIR ligands. RESULTS: All three cell lines were resistant to NK cell lysis, had some inhibitory KIR ligands and protease inhibitor-9, and expressed low levels of NKG2D activating ligands and adhesion molecules. After treatment with XmAb5574 or lintuzumab, MLL-rearranged leukemia cells were efficiently killed by NK cells. The addition of pan-major histocompatibility complex class I antibody, which blocked inhibitory KIR-HLA interaction, further augmented degranulation in all three KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2/3, and KIR3DL1 subsets of NK cells based on the rule of missing-self recognition. A mouse model showed a decreased rate of leukemia progression in vivo as monitored by bioluminescence imaging and longer survival after antibody treatment.

The aims of research on CTCs include (a) estimation of the risk for metastatic relapse or metastatic progression (prognostic information), (b) stratification and real-time monitoring of therapies, (c) identification of therapeutic targets and resistance mechanisms, and (d) understanding metastasis development in cancer patients. CONTENT: This review focuses on the technologies used for the enrichment and detection of CTCs. We outline and discuss the current technologies that are based on exploiting the physical and biological properties of CTCs. A number of innovative technologies to improve methods for CTC detection have recently been developed, including CTC microchips, filtration devices, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assays, and automated microscopy systems. Molecular-characterization studies have indicated, however, that CTCs are very heterogeneous, a finding that underscores the need for multiplex approaches to capture all of the relevant CTC subsets. We therefore emphasize the current challenges of increasing the yield and detection of CTCs that have undergone an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Increasing assay analytical sensitivity may lead, however, to a decrease in analytical specificity (e.g., through the detection of circulating normal epithelial cells). SUMMARY: A considerable number of promising CTC-detection techniques have been developed in recent years. The analytical specificity and clinical utility of these methods must be demonstrated in large prospective multicenter studies to reach the high level of evidence required for their introduction into clinical practice.',\n",

Here, we overcome  challenges associated with combining plasmonic gold with luminescent silicon nanocrystals for biological imaging applications by incorporating multiple silicon quantum dots into the core of a micelle and then depositing gold on the surface of the nanostructure. Within the newly developed nanoconstruct, the gold  shell exhibits plasmonic light scattering properties useful for dark field imaging, while the silicon nanocrystals maintain their photoluminescence. The result is a nanoplatform with both plasmonic and luminescent properties in a useful form. Multimodal imaging of pancreatic cancer cells demonstrates overlap of luminescence from the silicon quantum dots with light scattering from the gold shell. This approach can be tailored to other formulations and address the challenge of fluorescence attenuation that is typically observed when quantum dots are combined with plasmonic materials.

It is known that there are various mechanisms of regulation that can lead to gene dysfunction, including copy number change, methylation, abnormal expression, mutation and so on. Nowadays, all these types of alterations can be simultaneously interrogated by different types of assays. Although many methods have been proposed to identify altered genes from a single assay, there is no method that can deal with multiple assays accounting for different alteration types systematically. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a novel method, integration using item response theory (integIRTy), to identify altered genes by  using item response theory that allows integrated analysis of multiple high-throughput assays. When applied to a single assay, the proposed method is more robust and reliable than conventional methods such as Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. When used to integrate multiple assays, integIRTy can identify novel-altered genes that cannot be found by looking at individual assay  separately. We applied integIRTy to three public cancer datasets (ovarian carcinoma, breast cancer, glioblastoma) for cross-assay type integration which all show encouraging results.

Two expansion cohorts, comprising 10 breast cancer patients and 8 patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, were enrolled at the MTDs. The most common adverse events were flu-like symptoms (64 %) and nausea/vomiting (71 %). The most common Grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (26 %), flu-like symptoms (12 %), and pain (12 %). There were no relevant differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles of either drug when given in combination compared with alone. Thirty-eight subjects were evaluable for response, 18 (47.4 %) of whom experienced clinical benefit. Five patients (13.2 %) had a partial response  (PR) and 13 patients (34.2 %) had SD; the average time to progression in those with clinical benefit was 17 weeks (range: 7-28 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: This combination of imatinib and paclitaxel was reasonably safe and tolerable, and demonstrated evidence of anti-tumor activity. Further exploration in disease-specific Phase II trials is warranted.',\n",

The objective of this study was to show that the blood-brain barrier (BBB), through a combination of tight junctions and active efflux transporters in the brain microvasculature, can significantly restrict delivery of molecularly targeted agents to invasive glioma cells. Transgenic mice lacking P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) were used to study efflux of erlotinib at the BBB. A U87 rat xenograft model of GBM was used to investigate the regional distribution of erlotinib to the tumor, and brain regions surrounding the tumor. The effect of concurrent administration of elacridar on regional tumor distribution of erlotinib was evaluated. We show that erlotinib transport across an intact BBB is significantly restricted due to P-gp- and Bcrp-mediated efflux transport. We then show that the BBB is sufficiently intact in areas of brain adjacent to the tumor  core to significantly restrict erlotinib delivery. Inhibition of P-gp and Bcrp by the dual inhibitor elacridar dramatically increased erlotinib delivery to the tumor core, rim, and normal brain. These results provide conclusive evidence of the impact that active efflux at the BBB has on the delivery of molecularly targeted therapy to different tumor regions in glioma. These data also support the possibility that the repeated failure of clinical trials of new drugs for gliomas may be in part due to a failure to achieve effective concentrations in invasive tumor cells that reside behind an intact BBB.',\n",

Patient-specific risk factors, chemotherapy-related and disease-related characteristics can affect the clinical  outcome and management of febrile neutropenia. Although many factors have been identified, they vary among different patient populations. We identified clinically-relevant febrile neutropenia predictors in Asian cancer patients through visualization of these factors. METHODS: A single-centered, retrospective study was conducted from May to July 2011 at a local cancer center. Demographics  and risk factor data were collated from electronic health records and four cancer registries. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Additionally, potential febrile neutropenia predictors were identified using categorical principal component and multiple correspondence analyses. RESULTS: A total of 583 patients were analyzed. Majority was females (79%), Chinese (75%) and diagnosed with breast cancers (60%). Six risk factors were identified as potential predictors: types of cancer (16.9-19.8% of variance), chemotherapy regimen (anthracycline-based 11.8-12.9%, taxane-based 8.1%), liver function tests (alanine transaminase 8.6%, alkaline phosphatase 4.0%), renal function tests (serum creatinine 3.1%), prior granulocyte colony stimulating factor use (5.6%) and diabetes mellitus (6.6-6.9%). In terms of cancer types, lymphomas were more predictive than breast cancers. CONCLUSION: From our knowledge, this is the first study that has identified clinically-relevant febrile neutropenia predictors in Asian cancer patients through visualization of their risk factors. The use of these predictors to identify patients at risk for adverse reactions, such as FN,  can allow clinicians to optimize prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating factor usage in these patients.',\n",

This study explored the catalysts for surgery and reactions to discontinuing OCS. Semi-structured interviews were completed with 21 women who had undergone surgery having initially chosen OCS to explore their screening experiences, reasons for and feelings about surgery, and reactions to discontinuing OCS. The invasive nature and frequency of OCS were not by themselves a catalyst for surgery. A number of catalysts, including abnormal OCS test results, and secondary considerations, such as age-related factors, were found to prompt surgery. The emotional impact of discontinuing OCS following BSO varied between relief, acceptance, and loss of reassurance. OCS appears to be an acceptable risk management strategy under certain circumstances, but varying factors can prompt the decision to opt instead for BSO. The complexity of this management change decision should not be underestimated and needs to be taken into account by clinicians assisting women making choices. These findings highlight the importance of the timing of decision-making about BSO and that risk management options need routine reconsideration, through clinical discussions, information and support.',\n",

We sought to test the validity of this new system on a separate prospectively collected cohort of patients from a recent multicentre trial of early-stage lung  cancer. METHODS: We reviewed the prospectively collected data from 1012 patients  undergoing pulmonary resection for early-stage lung cancer in the ACOSOG Z0030 trial. TNM descriptors and overall staging were assessed using both the sixth and seventh editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (AJCC/UICC) lung cancer staging system. Survival  results were analysed according to both staging allocations. RESULTS: Using the proposed criteria, the number of patients by stage in the sixth and seventh edition allocations, respectively, were as follows: IA (432, 431); IB (402, 303); IIA (39, 167); IIB (94, 70); IIIA (26, 40); IIIB (19,0); there were no stage IV patients by either version. Overall, 180 (18%) patients had a change in the stage group from the sixth to seventh edition versions with 76 (8%) being downstaged and 104 (10%) being upstaged. In the sixth edition staging system based on pathological stages, median survivals in years were as follows: IA, NA; IB, 7.7;  IIA, 4.0; IIB, 3.6; IIIA, 2.6 and IIIB, 2.4. Five-year survivals were: IA, 76.4%; IB, 62.0%; IIA, 47.8%; IIB, 40.4%; IIIA, 31.3% and IIIB, 44.4%. In the new system, median survivals in years were as follows: IA, NA; IB, 8.2; IIA, 4.4; IIB, 3.6 and IIIA, 1.8. Five-year survivals were: IA, 76.9%; IB, 65.0%; IIA, 48.5%; IIB, 42.9% and IIIA, 30.6%. Survival analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed more monotonic progression, distinction and homogeneity within groups in the seventh edition.

Patients with pT3N0M0, classified as stage IIa according to the 6th edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual, can now be classified as stage Ib, IIa, or IIb. We aimed to discuss whether these changes affect survival and determine other potential prognostic factors. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 302 patients with postoperative pathologic stage T3N0M0  who underwent esophagectomy between 1990 and 2005 at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify prognostic factors for survival and used the Kaplan-Meier method to compare survival difference in each prognostic factor, including tumor grade and location. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 46 %, with a median survival of 1,244.5 days. Gender, age, alcohol consumption, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and number of removed lymph nodes were independent prognostic factors in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Smoking was also a prognostic factor in survival analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method. However, histologic tumor grade and location had no significant influence on patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: Age, gender, alcohol consumption, FEV1, number of removed  lymph nodes, and cigarette smoking are independent prognostic factors in patients with pT3N0M0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, tumor grade and location may not be as strong predictors in these patients as indicated in the 7th edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual.',\n",

However, recent retrospective studies indicated that patients with tumours mutated in codon 13 of KRAS may benefit from treatment with Cmab in contrast to patients with tumours mutated in KRAS codon 12. METHODS: To study the functional impact of the subtype  of KRAS mutations on the efficiency of EGFR-targeted therapies, we correlated the KRAS mutation status of 15 colorectal carcinoma cell lines with the in vitro sensitivity of these cells to Cmab/Pmab. Mutations in the potential predictive biomarkers BRAF and PIK3CA as well as protein expression of EGFR and PTEN were also determined. RESULTS: Four out of seven KRAS-mutated cell lines were characterised by the p.G13D mutation. Treatment of these cells using Cmab/Pmab induced a significant growth inhibition in contrast to cell lines showing a KRAS  mutation at codon 12 or 61. Out of the eight KRAS wild-type cell lines, five were insensitive to Cmab/Pmab. These cell lines were characterised either by BRAF mutation or by absence of EGFR or PTEN protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Since KRAS p.G13D-mutated tumour cells may respond to EGFR-targeted therapy, we suggest including subtype analysis of KRAS mutations in prospective clinical trials. In KRAS wild-type tumour cells, BRAF mutations and loss of EGFR or PTEN expression may lead to resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy and should be considered as additional negative predictive biomarkers.',\n",

Interestingly, recent studies have shown that ion channels/transporters, which are known to conduct or transport ions across the cell membrane, also exhibit changes in levels of expression and activities in response to changes of extracellular microenvironment. More importantly, alterations in expression and function of ion channels/transporters have been shown to result in changes in miRNAs that are known to change in response to alteration of the microenvironment. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent data demonstrating the ability of ion channels/transporters to transduce extracellular signals into miRNA changes and propose a potential link between cells and their microenvironment through ion channels/transporters.

In the present study, we focused on the underglycosylated MUC-1 tumor antigen (uMUC-1),  which is directly linked to tumor progression from pre-malignancy to advanced malignancy in breast cancer and has been identified as the independent predictor  of local recurrence and tumor response to chemotherapy. We investigated whether changes in uMUC-1 expression during tumor development and therapeutic intervention could be monitored non-invasively using molecular imaging approach with the uMUC-1-specific contrast agent (MN-EPPT) detectable by magnetic resonance and fluorescence optical imaging. This was done in mice that express human uMUC-1 tumor antigen (MMT mice) and develop spontaneous mammary carcinoma in a stage-wise fashion. After the injection of MN-EPPT there was a significant reduction in average T2 relaxation times of the mammary fat pad between pre-malignancy and cancer. In addition, T2 relaxation times were already altered  at pre-malignant state in these mice compared to non-tumor bearing mice. This indicated that targeting uMUC-1 could be useful for detecting pre-malignant transformation in the mammary fat pad. We also probed changes in uMUC-1 expression with MN-EPPT during therapy with doxorubicin (Dox). We observed that tumor delta-T2s were significantly reduced by treatment with Dox indicating lower accumulation of MN-EPPT. This correlated with a lower level of MUC-1 expression in the Dox-treated tumors, as confirmed by immunoblotting. Our study could provide a very sensitive molecular imaging approach for monitoring tumor progression and therapeutic response.',\n",

Tumor location and lymph node status play a pivotal role in this tailored strategy. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of preoperative assessment of tumor location according to the Siewert classification and lymph node status per station with endoscopy/endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and computed tomography (CT). METHODS: In 50 esophagectomy patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), tumor location according to Siewert and N-stage  per nodal station as determined preoperatively by endoscopy/EUS and CT were compared with the histopathologic findings in the resection specimen. RESULTS: Overall accuracy in predicting tumor location according to the Siewert classification was 70 % for endoscopy/EUS and 72 % for CT. Preoperative data could not be compared with the pathologic assessment in 11 patients (22 %), as large tumors obscured the landmark of the gastric folds. The overall accuracy for predicting the N-stage in 250 lymph node stations was 66 % for EUS and 68 % for CT. The accuracy was good for those stations located high in the thorax, but poor for celiac trunk nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Given the frequent discrepancy between the endoscopic and pathologic location of the GEJ and the common problem of advanced  tumors obscuring the landmarks used in the assessment of the Siewert classification, its usefulness is limited. The overall accuracy for EUS and CT in predicting the N-stage per station was moderate.',\n",

In the classical model of corepressor action, SMRT binds to antiestrogen-bound ERalpha at target promoters  and represses ERalpha transcriptional activity and gene expression. Herein SMRT mRNA and protein expression was examined in a panel of 30 breast cancer cell lines. Expression of both parameters was found to vary considerably amongst lines and the correlation between protein and mRNA expression was very poor (R (2) = 0.0775). Therefore, SMRT protein levels were examined by immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray of 866 patients with stage I-II breast cancer. Nuclear and cytoplasmic SMRT were scored separately according to the Allred score. The majority of tumors (67 %) were negative for cytoplasmic SMRT, which when detected was found at very low levels. In contrast, nuclear SMRT was broadly detected. There was no significant difference in time to recurrence (TTR) according to SMRT expression levels in the ERalpha-positive tamoxifen-treated patients (P = 0.297) but the difference was significant in the untreated patients (P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, ERalpha-positive tamoxifen-untreated patients with high nuclear SMRT expression (SMRT 5-8, i.e., 2nd to 4th quartile)  had a shorter TTR (HR = 1.94, 95 % CI, 1.24-3.04; P = 0.004) while there was no association with SMRT expression for ERalpha-positive tamoxifen-treated patients. There was no association between SMRT expression and overall survival for patients, regardless of whether they received tamoxifen. Thus while SMRT protein  expression was not predictive of outcome after antiestrogen therapy, it may have  value in predicting tumor recurrence in patients not receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.',\n",

Pigs were embolized with DEBIRI (100-300 mum, 100 mg dose, n = 6) and blood samples taken over 24 h to determine plasma levels of irinotecan and SN-38 metabolite and for haematology and biochemistry. At 24 h an  IV infusion of 250 mg/m(2) of irinotecan was administered and the plasma levels taken again. This cycle was repeated 3 weeks later. A single animal was subjected to a more aggressive regimen of embolization with 200 mg bead dose and IV of 350  mg/m(2) for two cycles. Three animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks and the remaining four (n = 3 standard dose, n = 1 high dose) animals at 12 weeks and detailed histopathology performed. All animals tolerated the treatments well, with only minor changes in haematological and biochemical parameters. There was no overlap in drug plasma levels observed from the bead and IV treatments when given 24 h apart and no difference between the pharmacokinetic profiles of the two cycles separated by 3 weeks. Irinotecan plasma AUC values were similar in both the embolization and IV arms of the study. C(max) values obtained during the IV arms of the study are approximately double that of the embolization arms whilst T(max) times are shorter in the IV arms, supporting extended release of drug from the beads. Bioavailability for bead-based delivery was double that for  IV administration, which was attributed to reduced clearance of the drug when delivered by this route. No additive toxicity was observed as a consequence of the combined treatments. The combination of irinotecan delivery via drug eluting  bead and IV was well-tolerated with no significant clinical effects. Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest the bioavailability from bead-based delivery of  drug is double that of IV infusion, attributable to reduced drug clearance for the former.',\n",

However, studies of obesity and overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer are notably lacking, especially in population-based studies. METHODS: Active and passive follow-up were used to determine vital status and survival for 510 pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed from 1995 to 1999 in a large population-based case-control study in the San Francisco Bay Area. Survival rates were computed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were  estimated in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models as measures of the association between pre-diagnostic obesity and pancreatic cancer survival. RESULTS: An elevated hazard ratio of 1.3 (95 % CI, 0.91-1.81) was observed for obese [body mass index (BMI) >/= 30] compared with normal range BMI (<25) patients. Associations between BMI and overall survival did not statistically significantly vary by known prognostic and risk factors (all p-interaction >/=0.18), yet elevated HRs consistently were observed for obese compared with normal BMI patients [localized disease at diagnosis (HR, 3.1), surgical resection (HR, 1.6), ever smokers (HR, 1.6), diabetics (HR, 3.3)]. Poor survival was observed among men, older patients, more recent and current smokers, whereas improved survival was observed for Asian/Pacific Islanders. CONCLUSIONS: Our results in general provide limited support for an association between pre-diagnostic obesity and decreased survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.

A 14-year-old male patient presented with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, and a  strong family history of colon cancer. Clinical sequencing of CDH1 and APC were negative. Whole exome sequencing was therefore applied to capture the majority of protein-coding regions for the identification of single-nucleotide variants, small insertion/deletions, and copy number abnormalities in the patient's germline as well as primary tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from  the patient's blood, primary tumor, and the unaffected mother's blood. DNA libraries were constructed and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000. Data were post-processed using Picard and Samtools, then analyzed with the Genome Analysis  Toolkit. Variants were annotated using an in-house Ensembl-based program. Copy number was assessed using ExomeCNV. RESULTS: Each sample was sequenced to a mean  depth of coverage of greater than 120x. A rare non-synonymous coding single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in TP53 was identified in the germline. There were 10 somatic cancer protein-damaging variants that were not observed in the unaffected mother genome. ExomeCNV comparing tumor to the patient's germline, identified abnormal copy number, spanning 6,946 genes. CONCLUSION: We present an  unusual case of Li-Fraumeni detected by whole exome sequencing.

DESIGN: Cohort study based on data from a prospective clinical database and electronically registered medical records. SETTING: Six major colorectal centres in eastern Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 2766 patients (1441 (52%) men) undergoing elective operation for colorectal cancer with colonic or rectal resection and primary anastomosis between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2009. Median age was 70 years (interquartile range 62-77). INTERVENTION: Postoperative use of NSAID (defined as at least two days of NSAID treatment in the first seven days after surgery). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of clinical anastomotic leakage verified at reoperation; mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: Of 2756 patients with available data and included in the final analysis, 1871 (68%)  did not receive postoperative NSAID treatment (controls) and 885 (32%) did. In the NSAID group, 655 (74%) patients received ibuprofen and 226 (26%) received diclofenac. Anastomotic leakage verified at reoperation was significantly increased among patients receiving diclofenac and ibuprofen treatment, compared with controls (12.8% and 8.2% v 5.1%; P<0.001). After unadjusted analyses and when compared with controls, more patients had anastomotic leakage after treatment with diclofenac (7.8% (95% confidence interval 3.9% to 12.8%)) and ibuprofen (3.2% (1.0% to 5.7%)). But after multivariate logistic regression analysis, only diclofenac treatment was a risk factor for leakage (odds ratio 7.2 (95% confidence interval 3.8 to 13.4), P<0.001; ibuprofen 1.5 (0.8 to 2.9), P=0.18). Other risk factors for anastomotic leakage were male sex, rectal (v colonic) anastomosis, and blood transfusion. 30 day mortality was comparable in the three groups (diclofenac 1.8% v ibuprofen 4.1% v controls 3.2%; P=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Diclofenac treatment could result in an increased proportion of patients with anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery.

The involvement of galectin-3 in the invasiveness of colon cancer cells remains to be determined. We investigated whether galectin-3 was involved in the colon cancer cell migration mediated by certain kinase pathways.  METHODS: We studied 2 colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1 and Caco2) and clinical samples. Immunostaining and Western blotting were used to analyze the expression  of galectin-3 in vitro and in the clinical samples. Short hairpin RNA and overexpression of galectin-3 were used to study loss- and gain-of-function in a wound-healing assay and a Transwell migration assay, and Western blotting was used to study the Ras-Raf signaling pathway. RESULTS: Galectin-3 was expressed at lower levels in DLD-1 than in Caco2 cells. The lower galectin-3 level in DLD-1 cells was associated with decreased cell migration, in comparison with that of Caco2 cells. Overexpression of galectin-3 increased the migration rate of DLD-1,  while knockdown of galectin-3 decreased the migration. Overexpression of galectin-3 was correlated with increased lamellipodia formation and distal lung localization in a mouse model. The galectin-3 enhancement of DLD-1 cell migration was mediated by K-Ras, Raf and Erk1/2 pathway activation, but not the H-Ras, p38, or JNK activation. CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3 plays an important role in regulating  colon cancer cell migration and potential distal localization. The galectin-3 enhancement of cell migration is mediated through the K-Ras-Raf-Erk1/2 pathway. Specific targeting of the K-Ras-Raf-Erk1/2 pathway may be useful for treating colon cancers associated with increased galectin-3 expression.',\n",

Variant MTL-52-LCR-02 was detected more frequently in women with cancer (28.6%, 95% CI 7.6%-64.8%) than in  women without cancer or CIN2,3 (0%, 95% CI 0.0%-9.2%; p = 0.015). CIN2,3 risk was significantly associated with a deletion at nucleotide position 7695 in the LCR (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.2-20.8), the T7744C variation in the LCR (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.1-32.0), and the K93R variation in E6 (OR 6.9, 95% CI 1.3-36.8), after adjusting for age, detection of HPV16 or 18 and study site. These findings indicate that HPV52 polymorphism influences risk of CIN-2,3 and possibly invasive cancer.',\n",

In this study, we examined LSD1 expression in 60 paired liver cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues by Western blot. In addition, we analyzed LSD1 expression in 198 HCC samples by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between LSD1 expression and clinicopathological features was investigated. The HCC cell line SMMC-7721 was transfected with LSD1 siRNA expressing plasmids. We subsequently examined in  vitro cell growth using the MTT assay and anchorage-independent growth through a  soft-agar colony-formation assay. In addition, the expression levels of Bcl-2 and c-Myc were also examined. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting consistently  confirmed LSD1 overexpression in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-neoplastic tissues (P < 0.01). Additionally, immunostaining showed more LSD1-positive cells in the higher tumor stage (T3-4) and tumor grade (G3) than in the lower tumor stage (T1-2, P < 0.001) and tumor grade (G1-2, P < 0.001). Knockdown of LSD1 expression in HCC cells led to decreased cell proliferation. The expression of Bcl-2 and c-Myc were down-regulated after transfection of LSD1  siRNA into HCC cell line SMMC-7721. In conclusion, because LSD1 was overexpressed in HCC and has an important role in the development of HCC, LSD1 could be a latent target in the diagnosis and therapy of HCC.',\n",

When the International Outreach Program at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital  established partner sites in low-income countries, few nurses had pediatric oncology skills or experience. A comprehensive nursing program was developed to promote the provision of quality nursing care, and in this manuscript we describe the program's impact on 20 selected Joint Commission International (JCI) quality  standards at the National Pediatric Oncology Unit in Guatemala. We utilized JCI standards to focus the nursing evaluation and implementation of improvements. These standards were developed to assess public hospitals in low-income countries and are recognized as the gold standard of international quality evaluation. METHODS: We compared the number of JCI standards met before and after the nursing program was implemented using direct observation of nursing care; review of medical records, policies, procedures, and job descriptions; and interviews with  staff. RESULTS: In 2006, only 1 of the 20 standards was met fully, 2 partially, and 17 not met. In 2009, 16 were met fully, 1 partially, and 3 not met. Several factors contributed to the improvement. The pre-program quality evaluation provided objective and credible findings and an organizational framework for implementing change. The medical, administrative, and nursing staff worked together to improve nursing standards. CONCLUSION: A systematic approach and involvement of all hospital disciplines led to significant improvement in nursing care that was reflected by fully meeting 16 of 20 standards.\",\n",

Tumor samples obtained by autopsy provide an innovative way to study tumor progression, potentially aiding in the discovery of new treatments and increased  survival rates. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to autopsies and develop guidelines for requesting autopsies for research purposes. PROCEDURE: Families of children treated for childhood cancer were referred by patient advocacy groups and surveyed about attitudes and experiences with research autopsies. From 60 interviews, barriers to autopsy and tumor banking were identified. An additional 14 interviews were conducted with medical and scientific experts. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of parents of deceased children did or would have consented to a research autopsy if presented with the option; however, only half of these families were given the opportunity to donate autopsy tissue for research. The most significant barriers were the physicians' reluctance to ask a grieving family and lack of awareness about research opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: The value of donating tumor samples to research via an autopsy should be promoted to all groups managing pediatric cancer patients. Not only does autopsy tumor banking offer a potentially important medical and scientific impact, but the opportunity to contribute this Legacy Gift of autopsy  tumor tissue also creates a positive outlet for the grieving family.

Since bone metastases are difficult to diagnose with the current available approaches,  there is a demand for new methods for assessing bone response.

In this study we tested a panel of bone remodeling markers (distinguishing between bone formation  and bone resorption ones) in different groups of cancer patients, so as to evaluate the potential clinical role of the examined bone remodeling markers in the early diagnosis of metastases formation and progression. Among the bone resorption markers, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) resulted the  most specific for the metastatic tumor stage. Both the bone formation markers we  analyzed displayed a direct correlation (positive for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP] and negative for osteocalcin [OC]) with tumor disease progression, ranging from healthy controls to primary tumor and, ultimately, to the metastatic stage. Taken together our results suggest that these markers can be valuable tools to be used, in parallel with traditional methods of metastases  diagnosis, in order to monitor more in detail the pathological effect of metastases progression in bone tissue.',\n",

METHODS: Fifty-five patients with stage II/III invasive breast cancer were enrolled into a preoperative clinical trial. Patients were given PC with sequential single-agent doxorubicin and paclitaxel vs paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin. Blood samples (8 mL) were collected from patients before PC, after each phase, and at 6 months intervals during follow-up. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and enriched for epithelial cells. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the presence of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA. Samples  were considered positive when the PCR curve crossed the standard threshold curve. RESULTS: After the first phase of chemotherapy, there was a 59% overall reduction in the median tumor volume. The percentage of volume reduction did not differ between patients who presented with detectable CTCs at baseline and those who did not (p=0.89). After the second phase of chemotherapy, there was a further decrease in the median tumor volume to 93% from baseline. There was no correlation between the lack of response and the presence of CTCs either after the first (p=0.36) or second (p=0.5391) phases of PC. The presence of CTCs was a  predictor of local or distant relapse (p=0.0411). The detection of CTCs did not affect overall survival (p=0.2569).

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Seventeen eligible studies reporting survival in 2,893 patients stratified by TS expression were pooled using a fixed- or random-effects model. The main outcome measure was hazard ratio (HR). RESULTS: The overall HR for overall survival was 1.01 (95% CI  0.74-1.39, p=0.947), with an I2 of 64.4%. The total HR for disease-free survival  was 1.36 (95% CI 0.97-1.89, p=0.072), with an I2 of 75.8%.

Variations in microsatellite length may constitute risk factors in several human diseases, a possibility that has been little explored in breast cancer. Among the genes that contain polymorphic microsatellites are EGFR, NOTCH4 and E2F4. The length of some of these microsatellites has been associated with breast cancer risk. PURPOSE AND METHODS: To determine whether the length of the microsatellites (CA)n in EGFR, (CTG)n in NOTCH4 and (AGC)n in E2F4 was associated with breast cancer risk, we genotyped these 3 microsatellites in 212 women with breast cancer and a control group of 308 women from the general population who did not have this disease. RESULTS AND  CONCLUSIONS: The allelic distribution observed for the 3 microsatellites matched  that found in other white populations, with the exception of some (AGC)n alleles  in E2F4, which have not been described previously. The length of (CA)n in EGFR and (CTG)n in NOTCH4 was not associated with breast cancer (OR=0.99; 95% CI 0.59-1.37; p=0.619 and OR=1.08; 95% CI 0.71-1.65; p=0.725, respectively).

This study aimed to disaggregate and describe these costs. PROCEDURE: A prospective, mixed method, cost-of-illness design was utilized. Starting in the fourth week following their child's diagnosis, parents recorded resources consumed, and costs incurred for 1 week per month for 3 consecutive months. Any additional costs not captured in this typical 1 week period were added for the remainder of the month. Parents also discussed their costs in an audio-taped interview at the end of the 3 months. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analyses were performed to disaggregate and describe families' costs. RESULTS: In total, 99 families reported utilizing 16 cost categories and 74 cost  items. Nearly three quarters of these costs were attributed to travel (56%) and food (18%). Costly items included acquisition of a car ($CAD35,000), relocation of a family ($CAD6,000), and purchase of a wheelchair ($CAD6,800). Parents described facing significant out-of-pocket expenses to ensure that their children had access to cancer treatment, to cope with the clinical treatment side effects  of treatment, and to maintain the family household. CONCLUSION: Families of children with cancer experience a wide range of costs. Our understanding of the nature of their costs and resource use may formulate the basis for future cost assessments and provide insight into practice and policy changes aimed at lessening the economic impact of this burden.\",\n",

We hereby present an interim analysis of a prospective observational study of ovarian function during cancer treatment of young females in relation to clinical factors. PROCEDURE: Thirty-four consecutive female cancer patients aged 0-18 year were included after informed consent. Serum/Plasma levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, FSH, LH, and oestradiol (E2) were measured at diagnosis and every 3-4 months during and after  treatment. RESULTS: All patients had detectable AMH levels at diagnosis. Eleven patients had reached menarche (mean age 14(1/2) years) and the remaining patients had a mean age of 6(1/2) years. They all showed a rapid decline in AMH after 3 months of treatment, regardless of AMH at diagnosis, age, menarche, or treatment  given. Those given radiotherapy below the diaphragm and/or stem cell transplantation (SCT) (n = 9) had no ovarian recovery during or 1(1/2)-year after treatment. However, recovery was observed in those given standard treatment for acute lymphatic leukemia (n = 7) already during maintenance chemotherapy. For the remaining patients, longer follow-up is required for analysis of ovarian recovery after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid ovarian dysfunction is observed in all females after initiation of cancer treatment as measured by AMH and inhibin B.

Based on data collected by means of a population-based survey, we evaluated the parental recall of the informed consent process for pediatric clinical trials, and how they rated the consent process retrospectively. PROCEDURE: A standardized survey was carried out among 1,465 parents whose children were first diagnosed in 2005 with a disease defined by ICCC-3 in the German Childhood Cancer Registry (response: 55.1%). The survey's primary objective was to assess how well parents were able to recall of the informed consent process. To evaluate the results, we set up a second survey among 581 parents who had given consent recently for their child's  participation in a clinical trial (response: 53.5%). RESULTS: Approximately 81% of the parents in the population-based survey correctly remembered whether or not their child had been enrolled in a clinical trial or treated off-trial. The ability to recall accurately is significantly lower if the parents have a migration background or if their child was not a trial participant. However, parents who recalled the child's trial participation status incorrectly felt as adequately informed as parents who recalled it correctly.

The pathogenesis is poorly understood, but the entity is hypothesized to be an immune phenomenon representing a host defense mechanism against the spread of tumor cells. Sarcoidlike reactions can occur at any time from the time of diagnosis to several years afterward and may occur in lymph nodes draining a malignant tumor, in the tumor itself, and even in nonregional tissues. Like sarcoid, sarcoidlike reactions of neoplasia can demonstrate hypermetabolic lymph nodes on (18)F-FDG PET imaging and thus be readily confused with metastatic disease. We describe 2 cases of a sarcoidlike reaction of neoplasia presenting as hypermetabolic thoracic lymph nodes on (18)F-FDG PET/CT obtained for follow-up of extrathoracic malignancies: one a 73-y-old woman with a history of stage III head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  and the other a 34-y-old woman with recurrent giant cell tumor of the sacrum. In  both instances, the differential diagnosis for the finding of hypermetabolic thoracic lymph nodes included the possibility of a sarcoidlike reaction, though tissue sampling was pursued to exclude the more worrisome presence of metastatic  disease or, less likely, a new primary malignancy.

The Eindhoven Cancer Registry registers comorbidity in all patients with primary CRC  in the South of the Netherlands. We analyzed the prevalence of serious comorbid diseases in four time frames from 1995 to 2010. Thereby, we addressed its association with age, gender and socio-economic status (SES). The prevalence of comorbidity was registered in 27,339 patients with primary CRC. During the study  period, the prevalence of comorbidity increased from 47% to 62%, multimorbidity increased from 20% to 37%. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were most prevalent and increased largely over time (respectively 16-29% and 12-24%). Pulmonary diseases increased in women, but remained stable in men. Average age at diagnosis increased from 68.3 to 69.5 years (p = 0.004). A low SES and male gender were associated with a higher risk of comorbidity (not changing over time). This study indicates that comorbidity among patients with CRC is common, especially in males and patients with a low SES. The prevalence of comorbidity increased from 1995 to 2010, in particular in presumably nutritional diseases. Ageing, increased life expectancy and life style changes may contribute to more comorbid diseases. Also, improved awareness among health care providers on the importance of comorbidity may have resulted in better registration.

We hypothesized that high IGF-I levels associate with increased cancer mortality, whereas low IGF-I levels associate with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. METHODS: Serum IGF-I levels were measured in 2901 elderly men (mean age 75.4, range 69-81 yr) included in the prospective population-based Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (Sweden) study. Mortality data were obtained  from central registers with no loss of follow-up. The statistical analyses included Cox proportional hazards regressions with or without a spline approach.  RESULTS: During the follow-up (mean 6.0 yr), 586 of the participants died (cancer deaths, n = 211; CVD deaths, n = 214). As expected, our data revealed a U-shaped  association between serum IGF-I levels and all-cause mortality. Low as well as high serum IGF-I (quintile 1 or 5 vs. quintiles 2-4) associated with increased cancer mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.34-2.58; and HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.37-2.65, respectively].

Zinc (Zn) functions as an antioxidant  and plays a role in maintaining genomic stability. Zn deficiency results in oxidative DNA damage and increased cancer risk. Studies suggest an inverse association between dietary and plasma Zn levels and the risk for developing breast cancer. In contrast, breast tumor biopsies display significantly higher Zn levels compared with normal tissue. Zn accumulation in tumor tissue also correlates with increased levels of Zn importing proteins. Further, aberrant expression of Zn transporters in tumors correlates with malignancy, suggesting that altered metal homeostasis in the breast could contribute to malignant transformation and the severity of cancer. However, studies have yet to link dysregulated Zn transport and abnormal Zn-dependent functions in breast cancer development. Herein, we summarize studies that address the multi-modal role of Zn dyshomeostasis in breast cancer with respect to the role of Zn in modulating oxidative stress, DNA damage response/repair pathways and cell proliferation/apoptosis, and the relationship to aberrant regulation of Zn transporters.

However, two other trials, including the PLCO study that enrolled 77 000 men, showed no statistically significant benefit from screening. Two meta-analyses showed that PSA screening did not reduce mortality from prostate cancer among 340 000 and 390 000 men followed for 9 to 15 years.

Dialysis and volatilization dialysis were used to prepare copolymer micelles. Drug-loaded micelles were compared with  blank micelles in terms of their particle diameter, morphology and IR spectral characteristics. The results revealed that there was no significant difference in respect of morphology and IR spectrum, but particle size differed. Drug-loaded micelles had a smaller particle size than blank micelles. Three important factors influencing particle size, the drug loading content (LC) and the drug entrapment  efficiency (EE) of the NCTD-loaded micelles, were studied. The results indicated  that the method of preparation and the type of organic solvent had a significant  influence on the size of the micelles. LC and EE were greatly affected by the ratio of NCTD to copolymer. In vitro release of NCTD from the conjugate micelles  showed that its release rate depended on the pH of the phosphate buffer solution  (PBS). The amount released was higher at lower pH than under neutral conditions.  In vitro antitumor activity of the NCTD conjugate against human hepatoma (HepG2)  cell line and human lung cancer (A549) cell line was evaluated by the MTT method.

Resected, stage I NSCLC tissues from survivor and fatal cases were immunostained with gamma-tubulin and scanned by confocal microscopy. Regions of interest were selected to include 1 cell and at least 1 centrosome. Four hundred forty-six regions were imaged, including 903 centrosomes whose features were extracted and measured. After segmentation, 12 centrosome features were measured. After optimization, 6 non-redundant features were selected for statistical analysis and classification. RESULTS: Two statistical methods showed that for each feature, centrosomes from survivors differed significantly from centrosomes of fatalities. Centrosomes were classified into survival or fatal outcomes by centrosome features using linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines (SVMs) and further optimized using SVMs with bagging.

High-risk and locally advanced prostate cancers are difficult to cure with the standard regimen of radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Multiple studies have explored the addition of docetaxel chemotherapy in attempt to improve patient outcomes. Prior Phase I studies have shown that docetaxel 20 mg/m(2) is a safe dose, when given concurrently with 70 Gy of radiation. But current standard RT for prostate cancer uses higher doses, and it is unclear if concurrent chemotherapy is safe with modern RT. This is a Phase I study that explored the addition of concurrent docetaxel chemotherapy to modern RT (intensity-modulated RT to 78 Gy) plus ADT. The study showed that weekly docetaxel at 20 mg/m(2) is safe with modern RT. At a median follow-up of 2.2 years, biochemical progression-free survival was 94%. This triple-therapy regimen is safe and promising for further evaluation in prospective trials. OBJECTIVE: * To evaluate  in a phase I trial, the feasibility of adding concurrent weekly docetaxel chemotherapy to high-dose intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for treatment of high-risk prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: * Patients with high-risk prostate cancer were treated with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (starting 2-3 months before IMRT  and lasting 2 years), IMRT of 78 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles, and weekly docetaxel during RT. * All patients had computed tomography and bone scans to exclude metastatic disease. * A standard 3 + 3 design was used for docetaxel dose escalation. Successive patients were treated on dose levels of 10, 15, and 20 mg/m(2) of weekly docetaxel. RESULTS: * In all, 18 patients participated in the study: 15 (83%) had Gleason 8-10 disease; the other three had either clinical T3 disease and/or a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of >20 ng/mL. * Grade 3 diarrhoea (a defined dose-limiting toxicity, DLT) occurred in one patient in each of the first two dose levels. However, when the cohorts were expanded, no further DLT was seen. * Weekly docetaxel at 20 mg/m(2) (dose level 3) was successfully given without DLT. * No patient had grade 4 or 5 toxicity. * At a median follow-up of 2.2 years, all patients achieved a PSA nadir of <1 ng/mL, including  13 patients who had an undetectable PSA level. The 2-year biochemical progression-free survival was 94%. CONCLUSION: * A dose of 20 mg/m(2) of weekly docetaxel given concurrently with high-dose IMRT and ADT appears safe for further study in patients with high-risk prostate cancer.\",\n",

The DYRK1A kinase is directly implicated in the resistance of cancer cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli and drives several pathways that enhance proliferation, migration, and the reduction of cell death, leading to very aggressive biological behavior in cancer cell populations. The DYRK1A kinase is also implicated in neurological diseases and in neoangiogenic processes. Thus, the DYRK1A kinase is of great interest for  both cancer and neuroscience research. During the last decade, numerous compounds that inhibit DYRK1A have been synthesized. The present review discusses the available molecules known to interfere with DYRK1A activity and the implications  of DYRK1A in cancer and other diseases and serves as a rational analysis for researchers who aim to improve the anti-DYRK1A activity of currently available compounds.',\n",

This process, therefore, may be associated with a number of clinical problems including higher cancer mortality,  progressive AIDS, transplant rejection, and unwanted pregnancy. Withdrawal of enzyme-inducing AEDs will increase the concentration of induced drugs, bringing with it substantial risk of toxicity if doses are not concomitantly reduced. Yet  the potential widespread adverse health consequences of these interactions, both  with AED initiation and withdrawal, remain largely underappreciated. Furthermore, induction also affects enzymes involved in endogenous metabolic pathways, and can alter bone biochemistry, gonadal steroids, and lipid markers. Therefore, enzyme-inducing AEDs may contribute to the development of a number of comorbidities, including osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction, and vascular disease.  This process continues as long as the patient takes the inducer. Modern AEDs that do not possess this property have similar efficacy for the common epilepsies. Accordingly, perhaps consideration should be given to starting treatment with, or even switching patients to, non-enzyme-inducing AEDs.',\n",

A natural way to approach this task  is to estimate the accuracy of the test using a lesion-level analysis.

Postoperative pathological findings and patient characteristics were reviewed. RESULTS: In all, 42 patients were identified. After chemotherapy, necrosis, teratoma and cancer were identified in 25 (59.5%), 14 (33.3%) and three (7.1%) RPLN specimens and 15  (35.7%), 15 (35.7%) and 12 (28.6%) orchidectomy specimens respectively. Of the 25 patients with necrotic RPLN specimens 12 (48.0%) had active disease within the orchidectomy specimen (eight invasive cancer and four mature teratoma). The overall histological discordance rate was 38.1%. Findings in the orchidectomy specimens were more aggressive than those in the RPLN specimens (i.e. cancer worse than teratoma, which is worse than necrosis) in 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant disparity between orchidectomy and RPLND findings with viable tumour appearing frequently in the testis despite tumour-free RPLNs. These findings support completion orchidectomy as part of advanced testicular germ cell treatment.',\n",

Endothelial cells are the main target for the antiangiogenic therapy because they are non-transformed and easily accessible to angiogenic inhibitors. Antithrombin functions as a principal plasma protein inhibitor of blood coagulation proteinases and belongs to the family of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) which have common mechanism of inhibition. Antithrombin acquires a potent antiangiogenic activity upon conversion of the native molecule to cleaved or latent conformation. Cleaved and latent preparations of bovine and human plasma derived antithrombin inhibits capillary endothelial cell proliferation and the growth of human SK-NAS neuroblastoma and Lewis lung carcinoma tumors in mice but not the native antithrombin's. The native form of antithrombin binds with high affinity to vascular heparan sulfate proteoglycans containing a specific pentasaccharide sequence and it is this cofactor interaction that activates antithrombin to maximal rate of thrombin inhibition. Upon inhibitory complex formation with target proteinases the antithrombin undergoes stressed to relaxed transformation and lose their high affinity for pentasacchride. Low affinity relaxed conformation with reduced heparin binding like cleaved and latent are antiangiogenic but native high affinity heparin binding stressed conformation is not, indicating the critical importance of heparin affinity in antithrombin antiangiogenic function. Based on  evidence of interactions of the endothelial cell growth factors bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) and VEGF (vascular endothelial cell growth factor) with heparin like molecule in matrix, the possibility of antiangiogenic antithrombin to interfere with endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis through heparin mediated mechanism deserves serious consideration and investigation. It is also possible that cleaved and latent conformations with reduced affinity for heparins can also induce conformational change in the antithrombin which can open an epitope on the antithrombin surface for appropriate interactions on the endothelial surface for better antiangiogenic activity. This review illustrates the potential of antithrombin and other serpin family members as endogenous antiangiogenic proteins.\",\n",

The structure of the phosphonate group resembles the transition state observed during a peptide bond hydrolysis and therefore phosphonates are referred as transition state analogues.

Moreover, incorporation of a peptidyl chain at the N-terminus as well as an introduction of electron withdrawing or electron donating substituents within the ester ring structure allows for a generation of specific inhibitors that react only with target serine protease. The great advantage of the aminophosphonate diaryl esters over other classes of inhibitors is their stability in aqueous solutions, no toxicity and lack of reactivity with cysteine, threonine, aspartyl and metalloproteinases. The above resulted in their application as convenient tools to study proteases function and activity using in vivo and in vitro assays of different pathological disorders (diabetes, cancer metastasis, pulmonary diseases or hypertension); to determine the cellular localization of the proteinases (activity based probes), to be used in proteomic approach or as the reactive antigens to develop a catalytic function within the antibodies binding site.

The municipal context is not, however, focused primarily on advanced nursing care, and it is important to highlight RNs' prerequisites for care provision. AIM: The study's aim was to describe RNs' experience of providing palliative care for older people in a municipal context. Data were collected through focus group  discussions with 20 RNs from four different municipalities in southern Sweden and were analysed using conventional content analysis. FINDINGS: The results showed that the nurses experienced that it was they who cushioned the effects of unclear responsibilities between different organizations, but had limited legitimacy in the municipal context and in relation to other care providers. The results also showed that nurses lacked proper support and prerequisites for providing high-quality palliative care to older dying patients. CONCLUSION: The results pinpoint the importance of increased acknowledgement of nurses' knowledge and skills and a critical view on the effects of moving towards an organization composed of different consultants, which can lead to even more unclear responsibility for nursing care provision.\",\n",

However, these approaches are limited by a poor sensitivity and reproducibility of Pap cytology and low specificity for high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of HPV DNA detection assays. Early detection might be improved by complementing or even replacing these tests by markers which are more directly related to molecular events triggering HPV-induced carcinogenesis and thereby might deliver  more accurate diagnostic performance. The delineation of molecular changes which  occur during different stages of HPV infections and the identification of changes which induce neoplastic alterations allow for the detection of markers that specifically highlight the transforming stage of the infection where viral oncogenes are overexpressed and therefore allow for a more specific diagnosis of  lesions that require treatment. The evaluation of such markers in clinical studies revealed that some indeed show an improved diagnostic performance compared to Pap cytology or HPV DNA tests only.',\n",

To investigate this subject, LBC+HPV triage and conventional cytology were alternated in a population-based screening setting. Cases with abnormal cytology  were referred for colposcopy. METHODS: We compared the performance of LBC+HPV triage [n=4059] and conventional cytology [n=4261] in detecting CIN2 or worse [CIN2+] and CIN3 or worse [CIN3+]. We used logistic regression to assess CIN detection rates and abnormal cytology rates, which yielded unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We computed adjusted ORs from a multivariate logistic regression model that included potential confounders such as age, screening centre and time period. RESULTS: We found similar detection rates of CIN2+ by LBC+HPV triage and conventional cytology; the adjusted OR for the comparison of CIN detection rates was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.60-1.26) for CIN2+ and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.64-1.58) for CIN3+. We also found similar positive predictive values between methods. Thus, there was no advantage  in using LBC+HPV triage as compared to conventional cytology in terms of sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value to detect histologically confirmed CIN2+ and CIN3+. CONCLUSIONS: LBC+HPV triage may lead to a reduction in unnecessary work-ups for women with abnormal cytological lesions who are negative for high-risk HPV. It is important to continuously monitor abnormal cytology rates, both when testing a new method, and after the new method has become routine.',\n",

At this time, the two entities are tested for and treated with the same clinical algorithms, namely gynecologic cytology and molecular testing for HPV DNA. However, ADC arises more  proximally within the cervical canal and frequently occurs below the superficial  mucosal lining, precluding it from being easily diagnosed with cytologic examination. Furthermore, ADC has a more aggressive course than SCC and is significantly less responsive to radiotherapy. These factors combine to produce a lesion that is diagnosed at a higher stage and has an overall poorer prognosis than SCC. While both lesions have pathogenic origins with the high-risk species of Human papilloma viruses (HPV), the high association of ADC with HPV 18, a virus with a higher genome integration rate, suggests that the transformation pathway of ADC differs from SCC.

Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV  vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities).

The aim of this study was to compare recruitment of patients and bereaved carers from general practices in areas with different research network support, and identify challenges in obtaining samples representative of those in  need of end-of-life care. METHODS: Comparative analysis of recruitment from general practices to two face-to-face interview studies concerned with 1) carers' perceptions of transitions between settings for decedents aged over 75 years and  2) the experiences of older patients living with cancer at the end-of-life. RESULTS: 33 (15% of invitees) patients and 118 (25%) carers were interviewed. Carers from disadvantaged areas were under-represented. Recruitment was higher when researchers, rather than research network staff, were in direct contact with general practices. Most practices recruited no more than one carer, despite a seven fold difference in the number of registered patients. The proportion identified as eligible for patient interviews varied by a factor of 38 between practices. Forty-four Primary Care Trusts granted approval to interview carers; two refused. One gave no reason; a second did not believe that general practitioners would be able to identify carers. CONCLUSION: Obtaining a representative sample of patients or carers in end-of-life research is a resource intensive challenge.

SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT6, and SIRT7 have all been linked to carcinogenesis either as tumor suppressor or as cancer promoting proteins.

       " '23016858': {'AB': 'Post-translational modifications of cellular proteins by mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation are associated with numerous cellular processes. ADP-ribosylation reactions are important in the nucleus, and in mitochondrial activity, stress response signaling, intracellular trafficking, and cell senescence and apoptosis decisions. These reversible reactions add ADP-ribose to  target proteins via specific enzymes to form the ADP-ribosylated protein; the cleaveage of this covalent bond is performed via hydrolases. Deficiencies in these enzymatic activities lead to cell death or tumor formation, thus defining their functional roles and impact on human disease. Unlike mono- ADP-ribosyltransferases, poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) have been at the frontline of drug discovery since the 1980s. PARP1 is a valuable therapeutic target, with a central role in responses to DNA damage. With mono-ADP-ribosylation now linked to human diseases, such as inflammation, diabetes, neurodegeneration and cancer metastasis, novel and equally important functions of mono-ADPribosylation in cell signaling pathways can now be defined.  Recently, we reported mono-ADP-ribosylation of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6),  a small G-protein of the Ras superfamily. In addition to its involvement in actin remodeling, plasma membrane reorganization and vesicular transport, ARF6 contributes to cancer progression through activation of cell motility and invasion. Consequently, targeting this modification will counteract the pro-invasive effects of ARF6, providing innovative anti-tumor therapy. This review summarizes our present knowledge of the enzymes and targets involved in ADP-ribosylation reactions, and describes in silico approaches to visualize their site of interaction and to identify the precise site for ADP-ribosylation. This should ultimately improve pharmacological strategies to enhance both anti-tumor efficacy and treatment of a number of inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.',\n",

Firstly discovered by Warburg et al. in the beginning of the last century, it is now a widely accepted hypothesis that cancer cells possess a severely deregulated form of glycolysis also under aerobic conditions. Accompanied by a deregulated glycolysis is an increasing dependence on glucose and glutamine, this characteristic offers a striking opportunity for new kinds of anti-cancer drugs. A feasible approach in this endeavour is the combined use of metabolic and transcriptomic information. Microarrays provide nowadays a reliable way for accessing the transcriptomic layer, even higher layers of biological information are in the scope. In this review we present the possibilities and also the limitations of this technique starting from the early phase of the microarray to the modern concepts of bioinformatics and systems biology. By highlighting also clinicopathological possibilities it is demonstrated that microarray technology is able to integrate various layers of biological information. Case studies incorporating aspects of cancer metabolism into therapy relevant applications and some potential new targets of cancer metabolism for novel cancer therapies are pointed out. These new cancer therapies can lead to the establishment of personalized medicine by use of custom based microarray platforms introducing treatment options in clinical decision making.',\n",

AIM: This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the preoperative sexual functioning, quality of sexual life, and relationship functioning for male and female colorectal cancer patients and their partners. In addition, the mean scores of the patients and partners were compared with mean norm scores. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (N = 136) and their partners (N = 106) were recruited before surgical treatment in six Dutch hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Men completed the International Index of Erectile Functioning, while women completed the Female Sexual Function Index. All partnered participants completed the Golombok-Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction and the Maudsley Marital Questionnaire. The mean scores were compared with mean norm scores derived from the manuals of the questionnaires. RESULTS: All participants were in a heterosexual relationship. Female patients reported a lower quality of sexual life compared with male patients. Male partners reported a lower sexual functioning and a lower quality of sexual life compared with male patients. Colorectal cancer patients and partners (both sexes) reported a lower sexual functioning and a lower quality of  sexual life compared with norm populations but scored similar on relationship functioning.

Radiosensitivity is critically influenced by hypoxia; hence, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of potential radiosensitizers under variable tissue oxygenation. Since fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the only clinically validated regimen in LARC, efficacy in combination with this established regimen should be  assessed in preclinical models before a candidate drug enters clinical trials. METHODS: Radiosensitization by vorinostat under hypoxia was studied in four colorectal carcinoma cell lines and in one colorectal carcinoma xenograft model by analysis of clonogenic survival and tumor growth delay, respectively. Radiosensitizing effects of vorinostat in combination with capecitabine were assessed by evaluation of tumor growth delay in two colorectal carcinoma xenografts models. RESULTS: Under hypoxia, radiosensitization by vorinostat was demonstrated in vitro in terms of decreased clonogenicity and in vivo as inhibition of tumor growth. Adding vorinostat to capecitabine-based CRT increased radiosensitivity of xenografts in terms of inhibited tumor growth.

Over the last few years, several observational studies examined the association of statin  use with the risk of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after definitive local therapy. The objective of our present study was to summarise available evidence on this subject using the method of meta-analysis. Combined evidence from eight cohort studies did not definitively support the hypothesis that statins influence the risk of biochemical recurrence. However, there was considerable disagreement between individual studies in reported findings and conclusions. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies with statin use as the exposure variable and biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy for prostate cancer as the outcome. METHODS: Relevant publications were identified through PubMed/Medline/Embase databases. Pooled estimates of the hazard ratios (HRs) were computed using the inverse-variance weighting approach. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran's Q test. RESULTS: We identified a total of eight eligible studies, all based on the retrospective cohort design. Five of these were based on radical prostatectomy (RP) series and three on radiotherapy (RT) series. There was evidence of heterogeneity in the entire set of eight studies (P = 0.002) as well  as in the RP series (P = 0.05) and in the RT series (P = 0.01), when these were considered separately. Based on the random effects inverse-variance weighting approach, pooled estimates of the HRs for the risk of biochemical recurrence in statin users v non-users were 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.13) for the entire set of eight studies, 1.02 (95% CI 0.80-1.29) for the RP series and 0.71 (95% CI 0.44-1.16) for the RT series.

The presence of deficient and/or defective antitumor adaptive and innate immune responses, coincident with accumulation of MDSC in lymphoid organs and tumor parenchyma, supports the notion of a causal relationship. The potent ability of MDSC to inhibit several components and phases of immune response highlights the likelihood that targeting the inhibitory functions of MDSC may maximize the therapeutic potential of antitumor immunotherapy. In order to guide the rational development of immunotherapeutic strategies that incorporate inhibition of MDSC activity and enzymatic functions, thorough understanding of the role of MDSC in antitumor immune responses is required.

Here, we examined whether up-regulation of aquaporin 3 (AQP3) mRNA in cancer cells treated with 5'-DFUR represents a collateral transcriptomic effect of the drug, or conversely, AQP3 participates in the activity of genotoxic agents. METHODS: The role of AQP3 in cell volume increase,  cytotoxicity and cell cycle arrest was analyzed using loss-of-function approaches. RESULTS: 5'-DFUR and gemcitabine, but not cisplatin, stimulated AQP3  expression and cell volume, which was partially and significantly blocked by knockdown of AQP3. Moreover, AQP3 siRNA significantly blocked other effects of nucleoside analogs, including G1/S cell cycle arrest, p21 and FAS up-regulation,  and cell growth inhibition. Short incubations with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) also induced AQP3 expression and increased cell volume, and the inhibition of AQP3 expression significantly blocked growth inhibition triggered by this drug. To further establish whether AQP3 induction is related to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, cells were exposed to long incubations with escalating doses of 5-FU.  AQP3 was highly up-regulated at doses associated with cell cycle arrest, whereas  at doses promoting apoptosis induction of AQP3 mRNA expression was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we propose that the aquaglyceroporin AQP3 is required for cytotoxic activity of 5'-DFUR and gemcitabine in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29, and is implicated in  cell volume increase and cell cycle arrest.\",\n",

Men diagnosed with prostate cancer are increasingly involved in making their own treatment decisions and the current recommendations for treatment are based on informed choice. The absence of scientific evidence regarding optimum treatment choices underlines the importance of understanding which factors influence the selection of treatment by men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Previous studies have found that men diagnosed with prostate cancer were more likely to choose radiation therapy over radical prostatectomy if they were older and had a higher  PSA level. This is the first large-scale prospective study conducted outside the  USA to quantify the factors associated with treatment decisions for men diagnosed with prostate cancer. It found that men who chose surgery were younger, above average physical health, and had lower grade cancers on the Gleason scale; men who had radiation therapy were older and had reduced physical health, with ADT added when men had more advanced disease. About two-thirds of the men said they primarily made the decision about treatment themselves, with the remaining men either sharing the decision-making process with their doctor or else leaving the  decision more or less completely up to their doctor. These results highlight the  importance of having quality up-to-date information readily available to guide these decisions. OBJECTIVE: * To examine demographic, clinical and quality-of-life indicators for the treatments received by men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Australia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: * This prospective trial included men diagnosed with prostate cancer (n= 1064, response rate = 82%) between 2005 and 2007 in Queensland, Australia, sampled from urologists and hospital outpatient clinics. * Data were collected through telephone interviews and self-administered questionnaires. * Treatment received was categorized into five groups: radical prostatectomy; radiation therapy with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); radiation therapy alone; ADT alone; and monitoring. RESULTS: * Sharp contrasts in the choice between radical prostatectomy (47% of men) vs radiation therapy with ADT (30%) were evident among age at diagnosis, travel time to facilities offering radiation treatment, Gleason score, stage, body mass index and physical health. * Men who underwent surgery were younger and of above average physical health, and had lower grade cancers; men who underwent  radiation therapy were older and less fit. ADT, in both neoadjuvant and definitive forms, was administered for high-risk and more advanced disease. * Two-thirds (66%) of men stated that they made the final treatment selection themselves. CONCLUSIONS: * These results suggest that men's baseline health and tumour characteristics influence treatment choices. * Distance from tertiary treatment centres also influenced the treatment received and access to specialist urologists may play a role. * With most men indicating high levels of decisional  control, the importance of having quality up-to-date information readily available to guide their decisions cannot be overstated.\",\n",

This sequence provides an excellent opportunity for the prevention or early detection of the events preceding development of the neoplasm. In 1994, the International Agency for Research on Cancer defined Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) as a group I carcinogen for gastric cancer (GC). Evidence supporting a causal association has  been demonstrated by epidemiological data as well as by experimental animal models. A meta-analysis has shown an higher risk (odds ratio: 1.92) of progression to GC in infected compare to uninfected subjects, that increased to a value > 8 considering the surveys having a follow-up of more than 8 years. A crucial question remains whether and when precancerous lesions can reverse after  H. pylori eradication. While several prospective studies have cast doubts about this reversibility others obtained opposing results. Currently, H. pylori is recognized as a necessary but insufficient cause of GC. The most accepted model of gastric carcinogenesis provides, like for other cancers, a multifactorial pathogenesis, linked with a number of initiators and other continuator agents. This review presents a multidisciplinary point of view to approaching the relationship between H. pylori infection and GC, focusing on the potential benefits of bacterial eradication in slowing down or in inducing regression of precancerous lesions.',\n",

Despite the fact that there are several study reports from multicenters in the West, there are limited data on sun protection in tropical countries where the prevalence of sunburn as well as sun protection behavior and knowledge are low. In Bangkok, sun protection behavior among adolescents is different from the studies performed in the West. Schools are key  institutions in encouraging students to prevent themselves from acquiring problems of long-time sun exposure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the amount of time exposed to the sun, sun protection behavior, attitudes, and knowledge about sun exposure protection among secondary school adolescents in Bangkok, Thailand. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized, cross-sectional survey. All students from seven secondary schools in Bangkok (public/private, male/female/coed) were recruited in to the study. RESULTS: A total of 10,387 students were enrolled in to the study;  6176 (59.5%) and 4211 (40.5%) students were from grades 7 to 9 and 10 to 12, respectively. Male students significantly lacked proper sun-protecting behaviors  when compared to the female students in the use of sunscreen (9.4% vs. 28.0%, P < 0.001), staying under the shade (55.5% vs. 65.2%, P < 0.001), and use of umbrellas (5.2% vs. 12.1%, P < 0.001). Proper attitudes and sun-protecting behaviors among junior high school students were deficient when compared to high  school students in the use of sunscreen (57.1% vs. 60.6%, P < 0.001), types of clothing (10.5% vs. 15.3%, P < 0.001), and hat (3.2% vs. 3.9%, P < 0.001).

Cervical screening registers hold comprehensive information on screening, but not country of birth. A linkage study was performed in order to assess cervical screening behavior in migrants. METHODS: To assess screening participation, we linked year 2000 records for 12,541 Middle Eastern/Asian-born women 20-54 years of age, and an age and area matched random sample of 12,143 Australian-born women in the New South Wales (NSW) Midwives Data Collection (MDC), which records country of birth, to screening register records. Screening behavior after 2000 was assessed in women without a recorded prior cervical abnormality. RESULTS: The odds ratios for being screened at least once within a 3 year period, with reference to Australian-born women and adjusted for age, parity, socioeconomic status and smoking, were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81-0.97) and 0.74  (95% CI: 0.70-0.79) in women born in the Middle East and Asia, respectively. Screening increased with increasing socioeconomic status (SES), absence of smoking and greater parity in Australian-born women but little, if at all, in migrant women. In a sensitivity analysis in which hospital admitted patients were the source of population samples, some patterns were sufficiently different to suggest that selection for illness can affect the strength and direction of associations in linked data. CONCLUSION: Migrant women from Asian and Middle-eastern countries are less likely than Australian-born women to participate in cervical screening at the recommended interval. Their likelihood of screening is also less related to socioeconomic status, smoking and parity than that in Australian-born women.\",\n",

The level of leukotriene B(4) is high in pancreatic cancers. However, the roles of LTB(4) and  its cognate receptors in keratin reorganization of pancreatic cancers are not known. LTB(4) dose-dependently induced phosphorylation and reorganization of Keratin 8 (K8) and these processes were reversed by LY255283 (BLT2 antagonist). BLT2 agonists such as Comp A and 15(S)-HETE also induced phosphorylation of serine 431 in K8. Moreover, Comp A-induced K8 phosphorylation and reorganization  were blocked by LY255283. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed Comp A-induced K8 phosphorylation and reorganization in PANC-1 cells. Over-expression of BLT2 promoted K8 phosphorylation. Comp A promoted the migration of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and LY255283 blocked Comp A-induced migration, respectively. PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) suppressed Comp A-induced phosphorylation of serine 431 and reorganization of K8. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed the expression of pERK, and over-expression of BLT2 increased the expression of pERK  even without Comp A. Comp A induced the expression of active ERK (pERK) and BLT2. These inductions were blocked by PD98059. Comp A decreased PP2A expression and hindered the binding of PP2A to the K8, leading to the activation of ERK. PD98059 suppressed the Comp A-induced migration of PANC-1 cells and BLT2 over-expression-induced migration of PANC-1 cells.

Further studies were identified by a Pubmed search with no limitations and a review of references within those papers. Pooled analysis was performed where the data was available. RESULTS: Over the two year period, 539 new cases of CRC were discussed locally. Of these, 28 (5.2%) were found to have IPN.

For the quantitative estimation of triterpenic acids in the crude extracts an NMR based methodology was used and compared with the HPLC measurements, both applied for the first time, for the case of betulinic acid. Both extracts exerted cytotoxic activity through dose-dependent impairment  of viability and mitochondrial activity of rat insulinoma m5F (RINm5F) cells. Decrease of RINm5F viability was mediated by nitric oxide (NO)-induced apoptosis. Importantly, these extracts potentiated NO and TNF-alpha release from macrophages therefore enhancing their cytocidal action. The rosemary extract developed more pronounced antioxidant, cytotoxic and immunomodifying activities, probably due to the presence of betulinic acid and a higher concentration of carnosic acid in its phytochemical profile.',\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified all patients with primary low risk cancer at our institution. We excluded those with adverse pathological features and then matched histopathology, pharmacy, hospital episode and Cancer Registry records. We reviewed case notes on patients with subsequent muscle invasion (progression)  or disease specific mortality. Patients underwent post-resection surveillance and treatment using standard regimens. National and regional disease specific mortality rates were calculated from appropriate data. RESULTS: A total of 699 patients met study inclusion criteria. Median followup was 61 months (IQR 24-105). Of the patients 17 (2.4%) died of bladder cancer, including 13 of 14 with progression to muscle invasion and 4 of 19 with grade progression to high grade, nonmuscle invasive disease. On Cox regression analyses low grade dysplasia in the initial resection specimen and tumor weight were associated with disease specific mortality (p <0.003). Disease specific mortality in these patients was 5 times the background rate in matched populations. Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature and the low frequency of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low risk bladder cancer rarely progress to muscle invasion but they are at higher risk for disease specific mortality than the general population.

In this prospective study we evaluated the natural history of erectile function after prostate brachytherapy without supplemental therapy (external beam radiotherapy, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or androgen deprivation therapy) using the International Index of Erectile Function-15. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We  identified 119 patients who were followed at least 12 months after prostate brachytherapy between 2004 and 2010. Sexual and erectile function status were assessed before brachytherapy (baseline), and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months postoperatively using the International Index of Erectile Function-15. RESULTS: Mean total International Index of Erectile Function-15 score, and scores on the erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire and intercourse satisfaction  domains 3 months after brachytherapy were significantly lower than at baseline (p <0.05). They remained lower until 36 months after prostate brachytherapy. Erectile function was maintained 12 months after brachytherapy in 16 of the 48 men (33.3%) with a baseline erectile function domain score of 11 or greater. There was no significant difference in clinical features except the age of patients who maintained the erectile function domain score and their counterparts 12 months after brachytherapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that age 70 years or greater was the only predictive factor for deteriorating erectile function after brachytherapy (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate a global decrease in all domains of the International Index of Erectile Function-15 score 12 months after prostate brachytherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the testis cancer database from 1980 to  2007 to identify all patients treated with post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Patients with pure seminoma and nongerm cell histology were excluded from study. A total of 1,807 patients were identified, of whom 17 without recorded mass size were excluded from further study. Pathological and clinical variables were assessed by bivariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of nephrectomy at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. RESULTS: The overall incidence of nephrectomy at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was 14.8%  (265 of 1,790 cases). The incidence of nephrectomy was 17.0%, 18.9%, 13.6% and 8.0% in 1980 to 1988 (group 1), 1989 to 1997 (group 2), 1998 to 2002 (group 3) and 2002 to 2007 (group 4) (p = 0.0001). The nephrectomy rate for tumors less than 2, 2 to 5, 5 to 10 and greater than 10 cm was 6.0%, 5.8%, 13.9% and 31.9%, respectively (p = 0.0001). The incidence of nephrectomy based on retroperitoneal  histology was 10.3% for fibrosis, 14.5% for teratoma and 20.4% for cancer (p = 0.0001). The strongest predictor of nephrectomy at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was retroperitoneal mass size greater than  10 cm (OR 9.30, 95% CI 3.8-22.7). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of nephrectomy at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection has decreased in the last 3 decades.

Urine is readily available and noninvasive, and it represents a promising source of biomarkers for the early detection and prediction of prostate cancer prognosis. We identified promising biomarkers for urine based prostate cancer, examined trends and outlined potential pitfalls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed PubMed(R) and Web of Science(R) database searches of the peer reviewed literature on urine based testing for prostate cancer. Original studies of this subject as well as a small number of reviews were analyzed, including the strengths and weaknesses. We provide a comprehensive review of urine based testing for prostate cancer that covers the technical aspects, including the methodology of urine collection, as well as recent developments in  biomarkers spanning the fields of genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. RESULTS: The process of urine collection is subject  to variability, which may result in conflicting clinical results. Detecting prostate cancer in urine is technically feasible, as demonstrated by numerous proof of principle studies, but few markers have been validated in multiple large sample sets. Biomarker development using urine has been accelerating in recent years with numerous studies identifying DNA, RNA, protein and metabolite based biomarkers in urine. Advanced clinical studies have identified PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts as promising RNA markers for cancer detection and  possibly prognosis. DNA methylation analysis of multiple genes improves specificity and represents a promising platform for developing clinical grade assays. CONCLUSIONS: Urine based testing is noninvasive and represents a rich source of novel biomarkers for prostate cancer. Although urine shows promise for  detecting cancer, the ability to identify aggressive subsets of prostate cancer needs further development.',\n",

We identified predictors and trends in the use of procedures for post-prostatectomy incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) cancer registry  data linked with Medicare claims, we identified men 66 years old or older who were treated with radical prostatectomy in 2000 to 2007. The primary outcome was  performance of an incontinence procedure. Demographic and clinical predictors of  incontinence surgery were evaluated by multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 16,348 men treated with radical prostatectomy 1,057 (6%) had undergone at least 1 incontinence procedure by a median of 20 months after the procedure, including 61% who underwent the first incontinence procedure within 2  years of prostatectomy. Older age and residence in the South were associated with greater probability of an incontinence procedure. Black men and those living in nonmetropolitan areas were less likely than their peers to undergo an incontinence procedure. Of men treated with any incontinence procedure 15% underwent more than 1 type. Of those treated with bulking agents 39% also received a urethral sling or artificial urinary sphincter and 13% who received a  sling also had an artificial urinary sphincter. In 34% of the men who underwent any incontinence surgery artificial urinary sphincter placement was the only procedure performed. CONCLUSIONS: In this population based cohort of older men with prostate cancer only 6% underwent an incontinence procedure after prostatectomy.

However, most studies are retrospective with significant selection bias. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot prospective randomized trial evaluating perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy of open vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for consecutive patients was performed from July 2009 to June 2011. RESULTS: To date 47 patients have been randomized with data available on 40 patients for analysis. Each group was similar with regard to age, gender, race, body mass index and comorbidities, as well as previous surgeries, operative time, postoperative complications and final pathological stage. We observed no significant differences between oncologic outcomes of positive margins (5% each, p = 0.50) or number of lymph nodes removed for open radical cystectomy (23, IQR 15-28) vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (11, IQR 8.75-21.5) groups (p = 0.135). The robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy group (400 ml, IQR 300-762.5) was noted to have decreased estimated blood loss compared to the open radical cystectomy group (800 ml, IQR 400-1,100) and trended toward a decreased rate of excessive length of stay (greater than 5 days) (65% vs 90%, p = 0.11) compared to the open radical cystectomy group. The robotic group also trended toward fewer transfusions (40% vs 50%, p = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS: Our study validates the concept of randomizing patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy to an open or robotic  approach. Our results suggest no significant differences in surrogates of oncologic efficacy. Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy demonstrates potential benefits of decreased estimated blood loss and decreased hospital stay  compared to open radical cystectomy.

OBJECTIVES: This analysis was conducted to identify plasma proteins associated with CRFS in disease-free breast cancer patients. METHODS: Women were divided into those meeting the CRFS criteria (cases) and a control group on the basis of a diagnostic interview. Plasma samples were collected from 45 cases and 45 controls. Proteomic analysis was conducted using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization, a mass spectrometry (MS) technique. This was followed by further sample processing using one-dimensional gels and trypsin digest for protein identification using liquid chromatography and database searching. RESULTS: CRFS was associated with a statistically significant increase in the intensity of seven MS spectra. A subsequent search of proteins corresponding to the MS spectra identified four acute phase proteins associated with a nonspecific immune response (serum amyloid A, collectin, and subunits of immunoglobulin G and complement C1Q). CONCLUSION: These novel results (using a technique not previously used in fatigue research) add further weight to the hypothesis that CRFS may be precipitated and prolonged  by a nonspecific sustained inflammatory response. Importantly, this has been identified from a global analysis of plasma, which was conducted with no prior assumptions. Although these results need confirmation, we would suggest that future treatments for CRFS should consider focusing on the modulation of this presumed prolonged immune response.',\n",

METHODS: This is a retrospective study with a  sample of 60 consecutive patients who had been referred by oncologists for difficult-to-manage pain and whose initial palliative care consult was with either of the two physicians in the outpatient palliative care clinic. For each patient, lists were compiled of all prescriptions for controlled medications and  filled for the 90-day periods immediately before and after the initial consult. Data from patient charts were combined with information from the Virginia PMP, which included prescriptions written before and after the initiation of palliative care, written by prescribers both inside and outside the palliative care clinic. RESULTS: After the palliative care consult, the proportion of patients on long-acting opioids increased from 45% to 73%. Self-reported pain outcomes, which were compiled for the subset of patients who continued palliative care for at least 60 days, showed a median decrease of two units on a 0-10 scale.

Psychometric testing was then undertaken with 52 patients with CHF recruited from a multidisciplinary heart failure service to explore inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity of the newly adapted Needs Assessment Tool: Progressive Disease-Heart Failure (NAT: PD-HF). RESULTS: Health professionals (n=21) rated the tool as easy to administer, comprehensive,  and relevant for the CHF population.

In addition, the contribution  of medical factors (e.g., cancer site, and treatments) in explaining the changes  in these symptoms is yet to be established. OBJECTIVES: This prospective study investigated longitudinal changes of five symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, and pain) in patients scheduled to undergo surgery for cancer  (N=828). METHODS: The patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and a pain questionnaire at baseline and after 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 months. RESULTS: Several time changes were statistically significant but effect sizes only revealed one change of a medium magnitude, that is, a reduction of anxiety from T1 to T2 (d=-0.58). Women with breast or gynecological cancer were the only subgroups to exhibit significant changes (i.e., reduction of a small magnitude of anxiety symptoms from T1 to T2; ds=-0.27 and -0.30, respectively). However, numerous differences were found across adjuvant treatments, including greater variations in depression and insomnia scores in the chemotherapy group (ds=-0.71  to 0.20) and a transient increase in fatigue symptoms in patients receiving \"all\" adjuvant treatments (ds=-0.24 to 0.37). CONCLUSION: The severity of cancer-related symptoms varies during the cancer care trajectory, especially anxiety scores, which importantly decrease during the first few months after the  surgery. This study also suggests that treatment regimens better account for individual differences than cancer site in the evolution of symptoms.',\n",

Cut  points are used to determine if scores represent clinically relevant burden. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to explore the evidence on cut  points for the symptoms of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. METHODS: Relevant literature was searched in PubMed, CINAHL(R), Embase, and PsycINFO(R). We defined a cut point as the lower bound of the scores representing moderate or  severe burden. RESULTS: Eighteen articles were eligible for this review. Cut points were determined using the interference with daily life, another symptom-related method, or a verbal scale. For pain, cut point 5 and, to a lesser extent, cut point 7 were found as the optimal cut points for moderate pain and severe pain, respectively. For moderate tiredness, the best cut point seemed to be cut point 4. For severe tiredness, both cut points 7 and 8 were suggested frequently. A lack of evidence exists for nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, well-being, and shortness of breath. Few studies suggested  a cut point below 4. CONCLUSION: For many symptoms, there is no clear evidence as to what the optimal cut points are. In daily clinical practice, a symptom score >/=4 is recommended as a trigger for a more comprehensive symptom assessment. Until there is more evidence on the optimal cut points, we should hold back using a certain cut point in quality indicators and be cautious about strongly recommending a certain cut point in guidelines.',\n",

Bupropion is an antidepressive medication used for smoking cessation and also has been previously studied for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate bupropion's efficacy in controlling HFs in BC survivors. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled pilot study that enrolled 55 BC survivors who reported more than seven HFs per week. Subjects were randomized to  receive either bupropion 150mg twice daily for four weeks followed by one week of washout and four more weeks of placebo twice daily or vice versa. The primary end point was average daily HF activity (number of HFs and a score combining number and severity) reported while on bupropion or on placebo. Secondary end points were sexual dysfunction, depression, and quality of life evaluated with the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, respectively. RESULTS: Bupropion reduced HFs by 1.26 per day and the HF score by 6.31%, whereas placebo reduced HFs by 2.11 per day (P>0.05) and the HF score by 30.47% (P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between bupropion and placebo in the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30. At the end of the study, 47% of the  patients preferred bupropion, whereas 53% preferred placebo. There were no statistically significant differences in side effects between the study groups.

The present study is an attempt to evaluate and modify this instrument as necessary in light of the recent regulatory guidelines  from the Food and Drug Administration on the use of patient-reported outcomes in  clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: Overall, the goal was to identify patients' highest  priority cancer symptoms, compare these symptoms with those suggested by oncology experts, and construct a brief symptom index to assess these symptoms and categorize them as treatment-related, disease-related, or related to general function and well-being. METHODS: Patients (N=49) with advanced (Stages III and IV) HCNs were recruited from participating National Comprehensive Cancer Network  institutions and community cancer support organizations in the Chicago area. Patients completed open-ended interviews and symptom checklists. Participating oncology physician experts also rated symptoms. Content validity was obtained by  evaluating results alongside items in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy system. Eleven oncologists categorized symptoms in terms of importance and also whether the symptoms were primarily related to disease, treatment, or functional well-being. RESULTS: HCN-related symptoms endorsed as high priority by both patients and oncology experts were selected for the new National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck Cancer Symptom Index-22. The final version includes 22 items, which are broken down into disease-related symptoms, treatment side effects, or general function and well-being. The new scale has acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha=0.86), content validity for use in chemotherapy trials of patients with advanced disease, and concurrent validity as demonstrated by moderate-to-strong correlations with the existing Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy measure. CONCLUSION: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck Cancer Symptom Index-22 adequately reflects symptom and side effect concerns of advanced HCN patients as well as oncology physicians. This instrument can be used to evaluate the most important disease-related symptoms, treatment side effects, and function/well-being in patients with advanced HCNs in clinical practice and research.\",\n",

OBJECTIVES: To conduct an adequately powered trial of a home-based exercise intervention that can be facilely integrated into established delivery and reimbursement structures. METHODS: Sixty-six adults with Stage IV lung or colorectal cancer were randomized, in an eight-week trial, to usual care or incremental walking and home-based strength training. The exercising participants were instructed during a single physiotherapy visit and subsequently exercised four days or more per week; training and step-count goals were advanced during bimonthly telephone calls. The primary outcome measure was mobility assessed with the Ambulatory Post Acute Care Basic Mobility Short Form. Secondary outcomes included ratings of pain and sleep quality as well as the ability to perform daily activities (Ambulatory Post Acute Care Daily Activities Short Form), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue). RESULTS: Three participants dropped out and seven died (five in the intervention and two in the control group, P=0.28). At Week 8, the intervention group reported improved mobility (P=0.01), fatigue (P=0.02), and sleep quality (P=0.05) compared with the usual care group, but did not differ on the other measures.

However, data regarding patients followed at home are lacking. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between various factors recorded at the beginning of home care assistance and survival. METHODS:  A sample of consecutive patients admitted to two home care programs was surveyed. A preliminary consensus was achieved as to the possible variables easy to be recorded at home. These included age at the time of home care admission, gender,  residence, marital status, primary cancer diagnosis, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score, measures of systolic blood pressure and heart rate, cyanosis, use of oxygen, and body temperature. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System was used to  record the intensity of each symptom. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with a survival of less than 10 days (short survival) and patients with  a survival of 10 days or more (medium-long survival). RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-four consecutive patients admitted to home care programs were surveyed, of which 187 were male. The mean+/-SD age was 72.1+/-12.7 years. The mean survival was 56.2+/-65 days. Mean survival was 71.5+/-67 days (287 patients) and  5.6+/-2.7 days (87 patients) in the short and medium-long survival groups, respectively. No association between type of tumor and survival was observed (P=0.162). Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that male gender (P=0.020), older age (P=0.012), lower KPS scores (P<0.0005), systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg (P=0.003), heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute (P=0.0006), delirium (P=0.004), the use of oxygen (P=0.002), intensity of  fatigue (P=0.006), drowsiness (P<0.0005), anorexia (P<0.0005), dyspnea (P<0.0005), poor sense of well-being (P<0.0005), and distress score (P<0.0005) were associated with a survival of less than 10 days. Marital status, residence,  cognitive function, fever, pain, depression, and anxiety were not found to be significantly correlated with survival. In a multiple logistic regression model,  low systolic blood pressure and high heart rate, gender, delirium, use of oxygen, KPS score, drowsiness, anorexia, and dyspnea were significantly correlated with a shorter survival. CONCLUSION: Low systolic blood pressure and high heart rate, male gender, poor KPS score, anorexia, and dyspnea were correlated with a shorter survival. Moreover, patients with low systolic blood pressure and high heart rate, male gender, poor KPS score, and greater intensity of anorexia and dyspnea  are more likely to die within one week.

OBJECTIVES: To use a population-based method to assess the use of opioid analgesics within the community among older persons with colorectal cancer (CRC) before death and determine factors associated with the use of opioid analgesics. METHODS: Data were derived from a retrospective, linked administrative database study of all persons who were diagnosed with CRC between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2005 in Nova Scotia, Canada. This study included all persons who 1) were 66 years or older at the date of diagnosis; 2) died between January 1, 2001 and April 1, 2008; and 3) resided in health districts with formal palliative care programs (PCPs) (n=657). Factors associated with having filled at least one prescription for a so-called \"strong\" opioid analgesic in the six months before death were examined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In all, 36.7% filled at least one prescription for any opioid in the six months before death. Adjusting for all covariates, filling a prescription for a strong opioid was associated with enrollment in a PCP (odds ratio [OR]=3.18, 95% CI=2.05-4.94), residence in a long-term care facility (OR=2.19, 95% CI=1.23-3.89), and a CRC cause of death (OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.14-2.68). Persons were less likely to fill a prescription for  a strong opioid if they were older (OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.95-0.99), male (OR=0.59, 95% 0.40-0.86), and diagnosed less than six months before death (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.41-0.93).

RESULTS: A new model was iteratively developed and presents cancer comparative effectiveness research and important measures in a patient-centered, longitudinal chronic care model better reflecting contemporary cancer care in the context of the cancer care continuum, rather than a single-episode, acute-care perspective. CONCLUSION: Immediately relevant for federally funded comparative effectiveness research programs, the model informs an evolving framework articulating cancer comparative effectiveness research data needs, including evolutionary enhancements to registries and epidemiologic research data systems.

Tissue array platforms were generated containing samples of breast cancer and positive controls that were assayed by immunohistochemistry applying monoclonal primary antibodies anti-ER alpha, SP1 and 1D5. We noted a high concordance rate (96.7%) between the referred antibodies. Moreover, we calculated the Kappa factor (0.921), indicating that 1D5 and SP1 provided overlapping ERalpha expression results. Indeed, we observed controversial results only in 2 samples studied, which were ER-negative when stained with 1D5 and ER-positive when assessed with SP1. Total concordance of PS was obtained (Pearson and intraclass CF, 0.7351 and  0.6193, respectively). However, concordance between the antibodies seems to be more accurate in higher PS values. An excellent IS correlation between antibodies was observed throughout the population (Spearman's CF, rho=0.9150). Following the Allred score, 17 out of 42 positive BC samples diverged, with 1D5 always pointing to weaker staining than SP1. When calculating Spearman's CF of Total Score (TS) within the population, an excellent correlation between both the antibodies (rho=0.9238) was noted. Nonetheless, the results were less concordant among the BC-positive cases (rho=0.7743). Indeed, 20 samples were differentially classified using the antibodies (only 3 had higher TS with 1D5). Considering the mean TS of  all samples or of invasive ductal carcinoma, SP1 provided higher scores than 1D5  (p<0.05). We recommend the use of the anti-ER RMAb SP1 due to the high probability that the BC ERalpha status can be determined accurately as the reagent provides higher IS. Therefore, the A-score was higher than the MMAb 1D5.  Ultimately, higher IS and A-score decrease the possibility of ERalpha status misinterpretation and, consequently, inappropriate BC treatment that would compromise the patient's quality of life and overall survival. We recommend the use of anti-ER RMAb SP1 due to the high probability that the BC ER status can be  determined accurately as the reagent provides higher IS, therefore higher A-score, than the MMAb 1D5.\",\n",

The  FOxTROT trial aims to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy for colon cancer. METHODS: In the pilot stage of this randomised controlled trial, 150 patients with radiologically staged locally advanced (T3 with >/=5 mm invasion beyond the muscularis propria or T4) tumours from 35 UK centres were randomly assigned (2:1) to preoperative (three cycles of  OxMdG [oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), l-folinic acid 175 mg, fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) bolus, then 2400 mg/m(2) by 46 h infusion] repeated at 2-weekly intervals followed by surgery and a further nine cycles of OxMdG) or standard postoperative chemotherapy (12 cycles of OxMdG). Patients with KRAS wild-type tumours were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive panitumumab (6 mg/kg; every 2 weeks with the first 6 weeks of chemotherapy) or not. Treatment allocation was through a central randomisation service using a minimised randomisation procedure including age, radiological T and N stage, site of tumour, and presence of defunctioning colostomy as stratification variables. Primary outcome measures of the pilot phase were feasibility, safety, and tolerance of preoperative therapy, and accuracy of radiological staging. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial  is registered, number ISRCTN 87163246. FINDINGS: 96% (95 of 99) of patients started and 89% (85 of 95) completed preoperative chemotherapy with grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity in 7% (seven of 94) of patients. All 99 tumours in the  preoperative group were resected, with no significant differences in postoperative morbidity between the preoperative and control groups: 14% (14 of 99) versus 12% (six of 51) had complications prolonging hospital stay (p=0.81). 98% (50 of 51) of postoperative chemotherapy patients had T3 or more advanced tumours confirmed at post-resection pathology compared with 91% (90 of 99) of patients following preoperative chemotherapy (p=0.10). Preoperative therapy resulted in significant downstaging of TNM5 compared with the postoperative group (p=0.04), including two pathological complete responses, apical node involvement  (1% [one of 98] vs 20% [ten of 50], p<0.0001), resection margin involvement (4% [four of 99] vs 20% [ten of 50], p=0.002), and blinded centrally scored tumour regression grading: 31% (29 of 94) vs 2% (one of 46) moderate or greater regression (p=0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Preoperative chemotherapy for radiologically staged, locally advanced operable primary colon cancer is feasible with acceptable toxicity and perioperative morbidity. Proceeding to the phase 3 trial, to establish whether the encouraging pathological responses seen with preoperative therapy translates into improved long-term oncological outcome, is appropriate.

This microbiota is considered to play a number of key roles in the maintenance of host health, including aiding digestion of otherwise indigestible dietary compounds, synthesis of vitamins and other beneficial metabolites, immune system regulation  and enhanced resistance against colonisation by pathogenic microorganisms. Conversely, the intestinal microbiota is also a potent source of antigens and potentially harmful compounds. In health, humans can therefore be considered to exist in a state of natural balance with their microbial inhabitants. A shift in  the balance of microbiota composition such that it may become deleterious to host health is termed \"dysbiosis\". Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been implicated in numerous disorders, ranging from intestinal maladies such as inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer to disorders with more systemic effects such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atopy. Given the far reaching influence of the intestinal microbiota on human health a clear future goal must be to develop  reliable means to alter the composition of the microbiota and restore a healthy balance of microbial species. While it is clear that much fundamental research remains to be done, potentially important therapeutic options include narrow spectrum antibiotics, novel probiotics, dietary interventions and more radical techniques such as faecal transplantation, all of which aim to suppress clinical  dysbiosis, restore intestinal microbiota diversity and improve host health.',\n",

Protein microarrays have demonstrated to be cost-effective, high through-put and  powerful tools for screening and identifying tumor markers with only minute samples. Autoantibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were shown to be relevant tumor markers. However, due to the variability of immune response from one individual to another and depending on the type of cancer, detection of only one type of anti-TAA autoantibody is not sufficient to give a reliable and precise diagnosis. It is necessary to use a set of several TAAs for  determining specific autoimmune profiles. Therefore, combining various TAAs on different surfaces could improve sensitivity and specificity for anti-TAA autoantibody detection. Herein a panel of 10 proteins, including well-known tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and potential new biomarkers of breast cancer, were immobilized onto microstructured microarray under optimized conditions (spotting pH buffer, surface chemistry, blocking procedure), in order to determine an autoimmune signature of breast cancer. Sera from 29 breast cancer patients and 28 healthy donors were screened in sandwich immunoassays on the miniaturized system to detect the eventual presence of anti-TAAs autoantibodies.  Results indicated that the detection level of each anti-TAA autoantibody in a given serum sample was strongly dependant on the surface chemistry. Combining five TAAs (p53, Hsp60, Hsp70, Her2-Fc, NY-ESO-1) on two different surface chemistries (NHS and APDMES) allowed the significant detection of more than 82% breast cancer sera.',\n",

We studied non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that were found with elevated serum beta-HCG level during clinical trial screening. The first case is a 45-year-old woman who presented with a stage IV undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung eligible for chemotherapy. When screening  the patient for a clinical trial combining platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy, the plasma beta-HCG level was 19 IU/L (0-5 IU/L). The second case is a 64-year-old woman presented with stage IV poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung. When screening the patient for the same clinical trial combining platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy, the plasma beta-HCG level was beta-HCG 13 IU/L (0-5 IU/L). The serum dosages were double-checked and confirmed elevated beta-HCG level. The gynecological work-up definitely rules out an improbable pregnancy. The pathological examination was also checked and confirmed in the two cases a primary lung cancer. An immuno-histochemical reassessment of the pathological specimens with additional tests was performed: for one patient 25% of tumor cells expressed beta-HCG. As pregnancies were ruled out, the two cases were extensively discussed with the promoter and the patients finally treated within this clinical trial. The treatments are ongoing. beta-HCG is a specific marker for trophoblastic tumors of placenta and gestational tumors. Ectopic expression of beta-HCG was found in 20-40% of all common epithelial carcinoma, especially for tumors of the stomach,  ovary, liver and lung. Only few cases have been reported in the literature. However, in a young patient with high serum levels of beta-HCG two questions arise: is there a place for pregnancy? Are the pathology results accurate? All this could delay the appropriate management of these patients and also potentially prevents the participation of innovative therapeutic strategies. Therefore, knowing this rare but possible expression of beta-HCG by lung tumors may speed out the gynecological work-up and the reevaluation of the histological  samples in order to minimize the delay in the care of these patients and give them a chance to have new innovative drugs within clinical trial.',\n",

METHODS: All patients with stage IIIB-IV OC, FTC, and PPC undergoing primary cytoreduction from 2001 to 2010 at our institution were identified. In patients undergoing splenectomy, pathology was reviewed for the presence of PSM. Multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to evaluate factors associated with overall survival  (OS). RESULTS: Of 576 patients identified, stage was: IIIB - 23 (4%), IIIC - 468  (81.2%), and IV - 85 (14.8%). Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 430 patients  (74.7%), including 85 of 97 patients (87.6%) undergoing splenectomy. PSM was identified in 20 patients (20.6%) undergoing splenectomy, including 3 of 5 patients (60%) with radiographically identified parenchymal liver metastases and  17 of 92 patients (18.5%) without such radiographic findings (P=0.059). Age, preoperative albumin, residual disease, stage, bulky upper abdominal disease, IP  chemotherapy, and PSM were associated with OS on univariate analysis. Splenectomy was not associated with survival. Age, preoperative albumin, residual disease, stage, and PSM (HR=0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.77) were associated with OS on multivariate analysis. In the subset of patients undergoing splenectomy, OS was lower for patients with PSM versus those without PSM (28.5 v 51.2months, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: PSM is independently associated with decreased OS in patients with advanced OC, FTC, and PPC. PSM occurs in the setting of other evidence of hematogenously disseminated disease, but also occurs outside this setting. PSM should be considered a criterion for stage IV disease.',\n",

METHODS: Microarray analysis comparing matched EOC tissues and peripheral blood leucocytes (N=35) was performed to identify novel CTC markers. Gene expression of these novel markers and of EpCAM was analyzed using RT-qPCR in blood samples taken from healthy females (N=39) and from EOC patients (N=216) before primary treatment and six months after adjuvant chemotherapy. All samples were enriched by density gradient centrifugation. CTC positivity was defined by over-expression of at least one gene as compared to the healthy control group. RESULTS: CTC were detected in 24.5% of the baseline and 20.4% of the follow-up samples, of which two thirds were identified by overexpression of the cyclophilin C gene (PPIC), and just a few by EpCAM overexpression. The presence of CTCs at baseline correlated with the presence of  ascites, sub-optimal debulking, and elevated CA-125 and HE-4 levels, whereas CTC  during follow-up occurred more often in older and platinum resistant patients. PPIC positive CTCs during follow-up were significantly more often detected in the platinum resistant than in the platinum sensitive patient group, and indicated poor outcome independent from classical prognostic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular characterization of CTC is superior to a mere CTC enumeration or even be the rationale for CTC diagnostics at all. Ultimately CTC diagnostics may lead  to more personalized treatment of EOC, especially in the recurrent situation.',\n",

Biomarkers predicting CIN2-3 regression would be of great clinical value and could reduce unnecessary cone excision and associated complications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether punch-biopsy derived immunohistochemical biomarkers, local immune response, CIN lesion size and condom use are independently correlated to regression of CIN2-3. METHODS: A prospective  population-based cohort study of 162 women aged 25-40, with first-time onset diagnosis of CIN2-3 in colposcopy-directed biopsies was carried out. The median biopsy-cone interval was 16 weeks. Regression was defined as CIN1 or less in the  cone biopsy. RESULTS: The regression rate was 21% (34/162). pRb>30% in the lower  epithelial half was the strongest predictor for regression (30% regression, p<0.0001). If additionally a CIN-lesion was smaller than 2.5mm and CD4+ lymphoid  cells in the subepithelial stroma </= 195 per 1.04 mm basal membrane, the regression rate was 53%. In CIN-lesions>2.5mm and CD4+-stroma </=195, consistent  condom use increased the regression rate from 13% to 67% (p=0.003). If pRb was </=30%, the regression rate was low (6%).

Aberrant miRNA  expression leads to developmental abnormalities and diseases. The miR-135a is considered to be oncogenic; however, the functions and mechanisms of miR-135a in  colorectal cancer (CRC) are largely unknown. Thus, we investigated the functions  and mechanisms of miR-135a, especially its relationship with the metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) gene in CRC. The expression of miR-135a was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, while its effect on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was determined by MTT, without and with matrigel, respectively. The expression of MTSS1 was detected by western blot analysis. It was found that miR-135a expression was higher in human CRC samples than in non-tumor control tissue. Using SW480 and SW620 CRC cell lines, increased proliferation was observed in response to miR-135a. We also demonstrated that miR-135a promoted mobility and invasion via transwell assay with and without Matrigel, respectively, of CRC cells. In contrast, inhibition of miR-135a reduced their proliferative and invasive capability. MTSS1 was identified as a candidate  target gene of miR-135a by luciferase report assay. Western blot analysis showed  that the expression of MTSS1 was regulated by miR-135a overexpression and knockdown. Similarly, miR-135a-mediated cell mobility and invasion were reduced after MTSS1 was knocked down by small interfering RNA. These data indicated that  miR-135a promotes the growth and invasion of CRC cells, at least partially, through targeting MTSS1.',\n",

We assessed the value of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging in predicting upgrading on confirmatory biopsy in men with low risk prostate cancer. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: A total of 388 consecutive men (mean age 60.6 years, range 33 to 89) with clinically low risk prostate cancer (initial biopsy Gleason score 6 or less, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, clinical stage T2a or less) underwent endorectal magnetic resonance imaging before confirmatory biopsy. Three radiologists independently and retrospectively scored tumor visibility on endorectal magnetic resonance imaging using a 5-point scale (1-definitely no tumor to 5-definitely tumor). Inter-reader agreement was assessed with weighted kappa statistics. Associations between magnetic resonance imaging scores and confirmatory biopsy findings were evaluated using measures of diagnostic performance and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: On confirmatory biopsy, Gleason score was upgraded in 79 of 388 (20%) patients. Magnetic resonance imaging scores of 2 or less had a high negative predictive value (0.96-1.0) and specificity (0.95-1.0) for upgrading on confirmatory biopsy. A magnetic resonance imaging score of 5 was highly sensitive for upgrading on confirmatory biopsy (0.87-0.98). At multivariate analysis patients with higher magnetic resonance imaging scores were more likely to have disease upgraded on confirmatory biopsy (odds ratio 2.16-3.97). Inter-reader agreement and diagnostic performance were higher for the more experienced readers (kappa 0.41-0.61, AUC 0.76-0.79) than for the least experienced reader (kappa 0.15-0.39, AUC 0.61-0.69). Magnetic resonance imaging performed similarly in predicting low risk and very low risk (Gleason score 6, less than 3 positive cores, less than 50% involvement in all cores) prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human pancreatic cancer stem-like cells were treated with and without carbon ion and X-ray irradiation, and then colony, spheroid and tumor formation assays as well as gammaH2AX foci formation assay were performed. RESULTS: The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values of a  carbon ion beam relative to X-ray for the MIA PaCa-2 and BxPc-3 cells at the D10  values were 1.85-2.10. The ability for colony, spheroid formation, and tumorigenicity from cancer stem-like CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells is significantly higher than that from non-cancer stem-like CD44(-)/CD24(-)cells. FACS data showed that CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells were more highly enriched after X-rays compared to carbon ion irradiation at isoeffective doses. The RBE values for the carbon ion beam relative to X-ray at the D10 levels for CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells were 2.0-2.19. The number of gammaH2AX foci in CD44(-)/CD24(-) cells was higher than that of CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells after irradiation with either X-ray or carbon ion beam. The number of gammaH2AX foci in CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells was almost the same in the early time, but it persists significantly longer in carbon ion beam irradiated cells compared to X-rays. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion beam has superior potential to  kill pancreatic cancer stem cell-like cells, and prolonged induction of DNA damage might be one of the pivotal mechanisms of its high radiobiological effects compared to X-rays.',\n",

The application of nanoscale photosensitizers (NPSs) comprising molecular PSs and nanocarriers with or without other biological/photophysical functions is a promising approach for improving PDT. In  this review, we focus on four nanomedical approaches for advanced PDT: (1) nanocarriers for targeted delivery of PS, (2) introduction of active targeting moieties for disease-specific PDT, (3) stimulus-responsive NPSs for selective PDT, and (4) photophysical improvements in NPS for enhanced PDT efficacy.

DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic, urban, academic medical center, and a sport university swimming pool. PARTICIPANTS: Breast cancer survivors (N=68) were randomly assigned to either an  experimental (aquatic exercise group in deep water pool) group or a control (usual care) group. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group attended aquatic exercise sessions 3 times per week for 8 weeks in a heated deep swimming pool. Sessions lasted 60 minutes in duration: 10 minutes of warm-up, 40 minutes of aerobic and endurance exercises, and 10 minutes of cool-down exercises. Patients  allocated to the usual care group followed the oncologist's recommendations in relation to a healthy lifestyle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Values for fatigue (Piper Fatigue Scale), mood state (Profile of Mood States), and abdominal (trunk curl static endurance test) and leg (multiple sit-to-stand test) strength were collected at baseline, after the last treatment session, and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Immediately after discharge, the aquatic exercise group showed a large effect size in total fatigue score (d=.87; 95% confidence interval, .48-1.26), trunk curl endurance (d=.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.97-3.83), and leg strength (d=1.10; .55-2.76), but negligible effects in vigor, confusion, and disturbance of mood (d<.25). At the 6-month follow-up period, the  aquatic exercise group maintained large to small effect sizes in fatigue scores,  multiple sit-to-stand test, and trunk curl static endurance (.25>d>.90) and negligible effects for the fatigue-severity dimension and different scales of the Profile of Mood States (d<.25).

We were interested in identifying target genes regulated by Sp1, particularly those involved in proliferation and cancer.  Our approach was to treat HeLa cells with a siRNA directed against Sp1 mRNA to decrease the expression of Sp1 and, in turn, the genes activated by this transcription factor. Sp1-siRNA treatment led to a great number of differentially expressed genes as determined by whole genome cDNA microarray analysis. Underexpressed genes were selected since they represent putative genes activated  by Sp1 and classified in six Gene Onthology categories, namely proliferation and  cancer, mRNA processing, lipid metabolism, glucidic metabolism, transcription and translation. Putative Sp1 binding sites were found in the promoters of the selected genes using the Match software. After literature mining, 11 genes were selected for further validation. Underexpression by qRT-PCR was confirmed for the 11 genes plus Sp1 in HeLa cells after Sp1-siRNA treatment. EMSA and ChIP assays were performed to test for binding of Sp1 to the promoters of these genes. We observed binding of Sp1 to the promoters of RAB20, FGF21, IHPK2, ARHGAP18, NPM3,  SRSF7, CALM3, PGD and Sp1 itself. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of RAB20, FGF21 and IHPK2 and luciferase activity for these three genes related to proliferation  and cancer, were determined after overexpression of Sp1 in HeLa cells, to confirm their regulation by Sp1.

Therefore, we sought to identify novel PTPL1 substrates that may be important for tumorigenesis. In this current work, we demonstrated that mouse embryonic fibroblasts without PTPL1 catalytic activity fail to form foci when transfected with oncogenes. We proved that catalytic activity of PTPL1 is important for ES cell growth. Using a substrate-trapping mutant of PTPL1 we identified putative PTPL1 substrates by mass-spectrometry. One of these putative substrates was characterized as Valosin Containing Protein (VCP/p97). Using multiple biochemical assays we validated VCP as a novel substrate of PTPL1. We also provide evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of VCP might be important for its midbody localization during cytokinesis. In conclusion, our work identifies VCP as a new substrate for PTPL1, which may be important in cellular transformation. Our investigation link an oncogenic transcription factor EWS-FLI1, with a key transcriptional target protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPL1, and its substrate VCP.

Furthermore, we found that ATF5 expression significantly correlated with  advanced clinical stage (P<0.05) and poor differentiation of epithelial ovarian carcinomas (P<0.05). Previous studies suggested that ATF5 is required for the survival of cancer cells, but the mechanisms by which ATF5 regulates genes and promotes cell survival are not clear. Our data additionally demonstrated that interference with the function of ATF5 could markedly increase the apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells and identified B-cell leukemia lymphoma-2 as an ATF5-targeted apoptosis-related gene. These findings may provide potential therapeutic application in epithelial ovarian cancer.',\n",

Improvements in the clinical outcome of ovarian cancer will be achieved if methods can be developed to enable  the detection of these tumors at the earliest possible stage. Thus, it is critically important to identify and validate new biomarkers of ovarian cancer. HE4 expression was defined by immunohistochemical analysis of a wide range of benign, borderline, and malignant ovarian lesions, including serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell lesions of the ovary and in primary tubal  carcinomas and the normal fallopian tube. At the cellular level, HE4 was highly expressed in malignant ovarian tumors and in a wide range of benign and borderline ovarian lesions. In addition, HE4 was highly expressed in primary fallopian tube carcinomas and benign fallopian tubal epithelial cells. These results support the conclusion that HE4 is widely expressed in most benign, borderline, and malignant lesions of the ovary and the fallopian tube. The detection of HE4 expression at high levels in some benign lesions and normal tissues suggests that HE4 could have limited specificity as a marker of ovarian or tubal carcinoma. Furthermore, the relatively weak expression that was observed in many ovarian carcinomas indicates that HE4 could fail to detect some cases of  primary or recurrent disease.',\n",

In search of tissue biomarkers for prediction of lymph node metastasis of gastric adenocarcinoma, we analyzed gastric adenocarcinoma tissue using proteomic methods. We have done 2D-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS analysis in matched normal and gastric cancer tissues. We also evaluated the clinicopathological significance of expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in gastric adenocarcinoma using a tissue microarray of 218 gastric adenocarcinoma specimens. Cell invasion and migration assay were performed to confirm functional role of S100A8 and S100A9 using small  hairpin RNA lentivirus. We identified 8 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated proteins in gastric cancer tissues compared to matched normal mucosa. Of these, expression of S100A8 and S100A9 occurred mainly in stromal cells and inflammatory cells between tumor cells. Correlation was observed between small lesion size, decreased depth of invasion, a tendency to absence of lymphovascular tumor emboli, a decrease in perineural invasion and lymph node metastasis, and expression of stromal S100A8. In addition, increased expression of stromal S100A9 in gastric adenocarcinoma was associated with small lesion size and a decrease in lymph node metastasis. Functional analysis confirmed that down-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 by small hairpin RNA lentivirus induced an increase of migration and invasion in gastric cancer cell lines.

The recent international phase IV SAiL study (a Study of Avastin  [bevacizumab] in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous cell Lung cancer) evaluated the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab combined with standard chemotherapy regimens in routine clinical practice. Here we report the results of a subanalysis of baseline characteristics and efficacy data for Italian patients enrolled in SAiL. METHODS: In the SAiL study, patients with untreated locally advanced, metastatic  or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC received bevacizumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks plus chemotherapy for up to six cycles, followed by single-agent bevacizumab until disease progression. Efficacy was assessed in terms of time to  disease progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The Italian intent-to-treat population comprised 215 patients from a SAiL population of 2212  patients. At baseline, Italian patients tended to have less advanced disease than the overall population. Thus, the proportion of patients at enrollment with tumour stage IIIb and IV was 23.7 and 76.3 %, respectively, for the Italian population versus 19.7 and 80.3 % for the whole SAiL population. In addition, a higher proportion of Italian patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (72.6 vs. 37.2 %) and the prevalence of co-morbid conditions was lower in Italian patients (59.5 % of Italian patients reported a co-morbid condition and 60.0 % were receiving non-oncological treatment compared  with 73.3 and 73.4 %, respectively, of SAiL patients overall). The mean exposures to bevacizumab and to chemotherapy were comparable between the Italian patient group and overall patient population, although cisplatin doublets were more commonly employed in Italian patients whereas carboplatin doublets were more commonly employed in the overall SAiL population. The median TTP and OS times for Italian and SAiL populations were comparable (TTP, 7.8 months vs. 7.8 months; OS, 14.8 months vs. 14.6 months). CONCLUSION: The results of this subanalysis of the  SAiL study of bevacizumab treatment in routine clinical practice suggest that Italian oncologists tend to prescribe bevacizumab to a selected population of patients with less advanced disease than is the case in the overall population. Nevertheless, the first-line use of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy  offers clinical benefits to Italian patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC.',\n",

Surfactants or stabilizers were not applied during the diazotization. After the functionalized rGO was treated through mild sonication in aqueous solution, these functionalized rGO sheets were less than two layers, which was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. The water solubility of functionalized rGO after the introduction of polyethyleneimine (PEI) was improved significantly; it was followed by covalent binding of folic acid (FA) molecules to the functionalized rGO to allow us to specifically target CBRH7919 cancer cells by using FA as a receptor. The loading  and release behaviors of elsinochrome A (EA) and doxorubicin (DOX) on the functionalized rGO sheets were investigated. The EA loading ratio onto rGO-C(6)H(4)-CO-NH-PEI-NH-CO-FA (abbreviated rGO-PEI-FA, the weight ratio of drug loaded onto rGO-PEI-FA) was approximately 45.56 %, and that of DOX was approximately 28.62 %.

Screening for anal  intraepithelial lesions and cancers is performed at specialized clinics and relies on high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and anal cytology. Both approaches have  limited reproducibility and sensitivity for detecting anal cancer precursors. We  evaluated biomarkers for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease in a population of HIV-infected MSM. METHODS: A cross-sectional screening study with passive follow-up included 363 MSM followed at a HIV/AIDS clinic. All men had anal cytology samples taken and were evaluated using HRA and anal biopsies. Using a composite endpoint of biopsy results and cytology, we compared the performance  of HPV16/18 genotyping, HPVE6/E7 mRNA expression, and p16/Ki-67 cytology to detect high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasias (AINs). RESULTS: For all biomarkers analyzed, there was a significant trend of increasing percentage of men testing positive with increasing severity of disease (P < 0.001). HPV DNA testing had the highest sensitivity for anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (AIN3), followed by p16/Ki-67, HPVE6/E7 mRNA testing, and HPV16/18 genotyping. The highest Youden's index was observed for HPVE6/E7 mRNA testing, followed by HPV16/18 genotyping, p16/Ki-67 cytology, and HPV DNA testing. Increasing the threshold for positivity of p16/Ki-67 to five or more positive cells led to significantly higher specificity, but unchanged sensitivity for detecting AIN3. CONCLUSION: Molecular features of anal disease categories are similar to those of corresponding cervical lesions.

Following infiltration of macrophages upon breast cancer dissemination, there was a steady increase in pDC within the bone, which resulted in a sustained Th2 response along with elevated levels of regulatory T cells and  myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Subsequently, pDC and CD4(+) T cells, producing osteolytic cytokines, increased with tumor burden, causing severe bone damage. Microcomputed tomography and histology analyses of bone showed destruction of femur and tibia. The therapeutic significance of this finding was confirmed by depletion of pDC, which resulted in decreased tumor burden and bone loss by activating tumor-specific cytolytic CD8(+) T cells and decreasing suppressor cell populations.

METHODS: Twenty-one HT-BC patients, free of tumor, mean age 59.9 years, BMI 28,9 kg/m2, waist circumference 95.9 cm, with altered lipid profile (total cholesterol 269.0 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 54.9 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 184.0 mg/dL, and triglycerides 263.3 mg/dL) were recruited. They were recommended a 3-month period of diet followed by a 3-month period of treatment with AP 1 tablet/day. AP tablets contain berberine 500 mg, red yeast rice extract 200 mg (equivalent to 3 mg monacolins), policosanol 10 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2 mg, and asthaxantin 0.5 mg. RESULTS: The lipid profile was significantly improved by AP vs. diet: 1.8% decrease in total cholesterol on diet and a further 15.3% decrease with AP vs. diet (P<0.001); a 3.1% decrease in LDL cholesterol after diet and an 18.9% decrease after AP treatment vs diet alone (P<0.01); a 2.3% decrease in triglycerides after diet alone and a 36.5% decrease after AP vs. diet (P<0.05).

Patients who received supplemental external-beam radiation therapy were excluded. One hundred and nine patients (51.9%) received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT). One month after seed implantation, postimplant computed tomography and dosimetric analysis were performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to identify preimplant factors affecting postimplant prostate D90. The postimplant prostate D90 values ranged from 123.3 to 234.1 Gy (mean +/- standard error, 177.1 +/- 1.4 Gy). Postimplant prostate D90 differed significantly between patients who had and had not undergone NHT (P = 0.001). In  addition, simple regression analyses showed positive correlations with the estimated preimplant prostate D90, preimplant prostate volume by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), total radioactivity, number of needles, and number of seeds. On stepwise multiple regression analysis, postimplant prostate D90 showed significant negative correlations with NHT and preimplant prostate volume by TRUS, and a significant positive correlation with total radioactivity. In conclusion, NHT, preimplant prostate volume by TRUS, and total radioactivity are  significant preimplant factors affecting postimplant prostate D90 in prostate cancer patients treated with transperineal interstitial prostate brachytherapy with loose (125)I seeds.',\n",

We performed a cross-sectional case study of systolic, diastolic function and tissue Doppler imaging by echocardiography in children with cancer who received a certain cumulative dose of doxorubicin. Blood levels for NT-pro-BNP, cardiac troponin T,  and CK-MB were analyzed within 6 hours of the cardiac study.

Such depression can lead to serious and far-reaching negative consequences in patients with advanced  cancer: reducing their quality of life and causing severe suffering, a desire for early death, and suicide, as well as psychological distress in family members. For the management of their distress, cancer patients are more likely to prefer psychotherapeutic interventions to pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy is known to be effective for the management of depression among advanced cancer patients. Hence, psychotherapy is an important treatment strategy for alleviating their depression. Furthermore, patients with advanced and/or terminal cancer suffer from various physical symptoms and are forced to face a continuous decline in physical function. In addition, psychological defense mechanisms such as denial are frequently observed in these patients. Hence, an individually tailored and careful psychotherapeutic approach should be followed, which considers the specific nature of the advanced and/or terminal cancer. This review focuses on psychological interventions that can be utilized in the clinical oncology practice to ameliorate depression among advanced and/or terminally ill cancer patients, rather than focusing on the level of evidence for each intervention.

A second-generation photosensitizer, 2-[1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide (HPPH) has a long wavelength absorption, high-tumor selectivity, and shorter duration of skin photosensitivity. We investigated the efficacy of PDT with HPPH and gemcitabine in inducing cell death in multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines. METHODS: We used three pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BXPC-3) incubated with HPPH concentration of 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 microg/ml for 6 hours, followed by photoradiation at a light dose of 60 J/cm(2).  Afterwards, each cell line was treated with gemcitabine at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 100 microM and incubated for another 96 hours. Cell death was detected with SYTOX green staining. We also assessed the difference in cytotoxicity in adding gemcitabine before and after PDT. RESULTS: HPPH-PDT can effectively induce cell death in all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, with a 100% of cell death at the 0.5 microg/ml HPPH concentration. In contrast, monotherapy with gemcitabine alone (100 microM) only achieved <45% cell death. Combining gemcitabine to HPPH-PDT resulted in synergistic cytotoxic effect with 20-50% more cell death across all cell lines. There was no difference in cytotoxicity in adding gemcitabine before or after PDT. CONCLUSION: This is the first study on HPPH-PDT for pancreatic cancer. HPPH-PDT-induced cell death occurs in a dose-dependent manner. HPPH-PDT and gemcitabine have synergistic effects in inducing cell death in multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines.',\n",

METHODS: The author searched the MEDLINE database for articles on breast reconstruction and radiation therapy published between January of 2008 and June of 2011 and reviewed the abstracts of those articles to identify articles with information about the impact of irradiation on implant-based breast reconstruction. This subgroup of articles was reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-five articles were identified. Nineteen articles were reviewed in  detail. Eight articles provided level III evidence; one provided level I or II evidence from high-quality multicenter or single-center randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. Two articles provided level IV evidence from case series and were included in the review because they offered a novel approach or perspective. The most recent studies find a significant need for unplanned or major corrective surgery in irradiated breasts reconstructed with implants. Although breast implant reconstruction in irradiated breasts is associated with high rates of complications, only a minority of patients require  conversion to an autologous tissue flap. CONCLUSION: Although the majority of patients who undergo implant-based reconstruction and irradiation ultimately keep the implant reconstruction, patient surveys show that irradiation has a significantly negative effect on patient satisfaction.',\n",

Molecular targeting success of this magnitude has yet to be repeated for most solid tumors. To answer why imatinib remains an exception of cancer research, we  summarize key features and patterns of evolution that contrast CML-CP from prostate cancer, an example of a solid tumor that also shares a signature fusion  gene. Distinctive properties of CML-CP include: a large cell population size that is not geographically constrained, a highly penetrant dominant oncogene that sweeps the entire cell population, subsequent progressive and ordered clonal genetic changes, and the effectiveness of molecular targeting within the chronic  phase, which is comparable to the benign phase of solid tumors. CML-CP progression resembles a clonal, stepwise model of evolution, whereas the pattern  of solid tumor evolution is highly dynamic and stochastic. The distinguishing features and evolutionary pattern of CML-CP support why the success of imatinib does not carry over to most solid tumors. Changing the focus of cancer research from a gene-based view to a genome-based theory will provide insight into solid tumor evolutionary dynamics.',\n",

METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2005 California Health Interview Survey to ascertain cancer screening test use and to estimate the prevalence of health behaviors that may reduce the risk of cancer. We used logistic regression to control for demographic factors and health-care access. RESULTS: Women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer were more likely to be up to date with mammography as compared with women with no family history of cancer (odds ratio = 1.69, 95% confidence interval (1.39, 2.04)); their health behaviors were similar  to other women. Men and women with a family history of colorectal cancer were more likely to be up to date with colorectal cancer screening as compared with individuals with no family history of cancer (odds ratio = 2.77, 95% confidence interval (2.20, 3.49)) but were less likely to have a body mass index <25 kg/m(2) (odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (0.67, 0.94)). CONCLUSION: Innovative methods are needed to encourage those with a moderate-to-strong familial risk for breast cancer and colorectal cancer to increase their physical activity levels, strive to maintain a healthy weight, quit smoking, and reduce alcohol use.Genet Med 2013:15(3):212-221.',\n",

We aimed to define the basis of AHC/HH in 4 pedigrees of different ethnic backgrounds. One patient was elected to have testicular biopsy which was examined for evidence of carcinoma in situ (CIS). NR0B1 mutation analysis was performed by sequence analysis. NR0B1 expression was investigated by RT-PCR. Testicular biopsy sections were stained with HE or immunostained for OCT3/4, an established marker of CIS. We identified NR0B1 variants in the 4 AHC pedigrees: pedigree 1 (United Arab Emirates), c.1130A>G predicting p.(Glu377Gly); pedigree 2 (English Caucasian), c.327C>A predicting p.(Cys109*); pedigree 3 (Oman), a 6-bp deletion of a direct repeat, c.857_862delTGGTGC predicting p.(Leu286_Val287del); pedigree 4 (English Caucasian), c.1168+1G>A, a regulatory variant within the NR0B1 splice donor site. This last male patient, aged 30 years, presented with evidence of HH but incomplete gonadotrophin deficiency, following an earlier diagnosis of Addison's disease at 3 years. Hormonal therapy  induced virilisation. Testicular biopsy was performed. The c.1168+1G>A variant abrogated normal splicing of testicular mRNA. Histological examination showed poorly organised testicular architecture and absence of spermatozoa. Morphological analyses and the absence of immunohistochemical staining for OCT3/4 excluded the presence of malignant germ cell cancer and its precursor lesion, CIS. These studies add to the knowledge of the types and ethnic diversity of NR0B1 mutations and their associated phenotypes, and provide insight into the assessment and interpretation of testicular histology in AHC and HH.\",\n",

Photochemical internalization (PCI) is a photodynamic therapy-based approach for improving the delivery of macromolecules and genes into the cell cytosol. The utility of PCI for the delivery of the GFP reporter gene on the same plasmid as a tumor suppressor gene (PTEN) was investigated in monolayers of U251  human glioma cells and muticell U87 glioma spheroids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U251 monolayers or U87 spheroids were incubated in AlPcS(2a) and non-viral vector polyplexes for 18 hours. In all cases, light treatment was performed with a diode laser at a wavelength of 670 nm. The non-viral transfection agents, branched polyethylenimine (bPEI), or protamine sulfate (PS), were used with the plasmid constructs GFP/PTEN or GFP. RESULTS: PS/GFP polyplexes were much less toxic to the glioma cells compared to bPEI/GFP polyplexes but were highly inefficient at gene transfection if used alone. PCI resulted in a 5- to 10-fold increase in GFP  protein expression compared to controls. PCI-bPEI/PTEN or PCI-PS/PTEN transfection of either U251 monolayers or U87 spheroids significantly inhibited their growth. but had no effect on MCF-7 cells containing a wild-type PTEN gene.  In addition PCI-GFP transfection of gliomas cells had no effect on their growth pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the results suggest that AlPcS(2a) -mediated  PCI can be used to enhance cell growth inhibition via transfection of tumor suppressor genes in glioma cells containing mutant PTEN genes.',\n",

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of cancer in stroke patients and to compare mechanisms of stroke between patients with and without malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study involved patients with ischemic stroke admitted over 1 year to a Neurology Department. Demographic and clinical data, cardiovascular risk factors, and laboratory findings were recorded. The etiology was classified  following the TOAST criteria. Participants were classified as stroke and cancer patients (diagnosis of malignancy before stroke or cancer diagnosed after admission) or as control stroke patients. RESULTS: Over 1 year, 291 stroke patients (268 ischemic) were admitted. Sixteen ischemic patients had a malignancy (5.9%), and in 12 patients, malignancy was the only cause found for the stroke; in 4 patients, malignancy was a coexisting condition. Coexistent stroke and cancer was significantly related to higher median levels of fibrinogen, D-dimers, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Logistic regression analysis showed that D-dimer and ESR levels were independently related to cancer, with odds ratios of 1.004 (95% CI 1.001-1.007, p=0.02) and 1.075 (95% CI 1.031-1.121, p=0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 6% of ischemic stroke patients had a  concomitant malignancy. In most of them, cancer was the only cause of stroke found. Patients with stroke and malignancy exhibited raised D-dimer, fibrinogen,  and ESR levels, suggesting the prothrombotic state was a principal mechanism underlying stroke.

The currently used radioisotope (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a nonspecific tracer for cancer cells as it detects all metabolically active cells including inflammation. (18)F-fluorodeoxythymidine (FLT) is a radioactive tracer for rapidly proliferating cells, and therefore is more specific for detecting cancer. Our aim was to compare FLT and FDG microPET (positron-emission tomography) to the gold standard in vivo bioluminescence imaging for serial assessment of neoplastic growth in a minimal residual disease in vivo model. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective outcomes research. METHODS: In order to mimic the postsurgical environment of HNSCC patients FaDu cells transfected with a luciferase-expressing retrovirus were inoculated into the skin flap of Balb/c nu/nu mice. Three days later before  tumors formed, mice were randomized into (18)F-FLT or (18) F-FDG groups, and microPET imaging was performed on days 3, 6, 10, 18, and 24 after tumor cell inoculation. RESULTS: (18)F-FLT detected tumors as early as day 3 even before tumors were palpable, whereas (18)F-FDG only detected palpable tumors. The average overall normalized radioactivity in the FLT group was significantly higher than the FDG group (P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FLT identified tumor cells before tumors were palpable and can potentially be used for early detection of persistence/recurrence of HNSCC. In addition, this radioisotope can be used to monitor adjuvant therapy with novel targeted therapeutics in preclinical models of persistent disease.',\n",

Identification of hypermethylated regions allowing discrimination between normal cervical epithelium and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3), or worse, may improve current cervical cancer population-based screening programs. In this study, the DNA methylome of high-grade CIN lesions was studied using genome-wide DNA methylation screening to identify potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of cervical neoplasia. Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) combined with DNA microarray was used to compare DNA methylation profiles of epithelial cells derived from high-grade CIN lesions with normal cervical epithelium. Hypermethylated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified. Validation of nine selected DMRs using BSP and MSP in cervical tissue revealed methylation in 63.2-94.7% high-grade CIN and in 59.3-100% cervical carcinomas. QMSP for the two most significant high-grade CIN-specific methylation markers was conducted exploring test performance in a large series of cervical scrapings. Frequency and relative level of methylation were significantly different between  normal and cancer samples. Clinical validation of both markers in cervical scrapings from patients with an abnormal cervical smear confirmed that frequency  and relative level of methylation were related with increasing severity of the underlying CIN lesion and that ROC analysis was discriminative. These markers represent the COL25A1 and KATNAL2 and their observed increased methylation upon progression could intimate the regulatory role in carcinogenesis. In conclusion,  our newly identified hypermethylated DMRs represent specific DNA methylation patterns in high-grade CIN lesions and are candidate biomarkers for early detection.',\n",

It most often has a multifocal distribution within the gland, and different Gleason grades may be present within different foci. Data from our group and others have shown that the genomic deletion of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene and the disruption of the ETS gene family have a central role in prostate cancer and are likely to be associated with Gleason grade. In this study, prostate cancer samples were systematically analyzed to determine whether there was concordance between PTEN losses and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion rearrangements, within or between foci in multifocal disease, using well-annotated tissue microarrays (TMAs) consisting of 724 cores derived from 142 radical prostatectomy specimens.  Three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of both the PTEN deletion and the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was used to precisely map genetic heterogeneity, both  within and between tumor foci represented on the TMA. PTEN deletion was observed  in 56 of 134 (42%) patients (hemizygous=42 and homozygous=14). TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was observed in 63 of 139 (45%) patients. When analyzed by Gleason pattern for a  given TMA core, PTEN deletions were significantly associated with Gleason grades  4 or 5 over grade 3 (P<0.001). Although TMPRSS2-ERG fusions showed a strong relationship with PTEN deletions (P=0.007), TMPRSS2-ERG fusions did not show correlation with Gleason grade. The pattern of genetic heterogeneity of PTEN deletion was more diverse than that observed for TMPRSS2-ERG fusions in multifocal disease. However, the marked interfocal discordance for both TMPRSS2-ERG fusions and PTEN deletions was consistent with the concept that multiple foci of prostate cancer arise independently within the same prostate, and that individual tumor foci can have distinct patterns of genetic rearrangements.',\n",

However, the exact mechanism of 8-Cl-cAMP functioning  in cancer cells is not fully understood. Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) genes (Akt1,  Akt2, and Akt3) encode enzymes belonging to the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase family. It has been suggested that Akt/PKB enhances cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Recently, we showed that 8-Cl-cAMP and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) inhibited cancer cell growth through the activation of AMPK and p38 MAPK. Therefore, we anticipated that the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB would be decreased upon treatment with 8-Cl-cAMP. However, treatment with 8-Cl-cAMP and AICAR induced the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, which was inhibited by ABT702 (an adenosine kinase inhibitor) and NBTI (an adenosine transporter inhibitor). Furthermore, whereas Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), AMPK-DN (AMPK-dominant negative) mutant, and SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) did not block the 8-Cl-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, TCN (an Akt1/2/3 specific inhibitor) and an Akt2/PKBbeta-targeted siRNA inhibited the 8-Cl-cAMP- and AICAR-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK and p38 MAPK. TCN also reversed the growth inhibition mediated by 8-Cl-cAMP and AICAR. Moreover, an Akt1/PKBalpha-targeted siRNA did not reduce the phosphorylation of AMPK and p38 MAPK after treatment with 8-Cl-cAMP. These results suggest that Akt2/PKBbeta activation promotes the phosphorylation of AMPK and p38 MAPK during the 8-Cl-cAMP- and AICAR-induced growth inhibition.',\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with cervical cancer who received CCRT were examined with 3 Tesla (T) MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). All patients had three serial MR examinations:  before therapy (pre-Tx); at 4 weeks of therapy (mid-Tx); and 1 month after completion of therapy (post-Tx). At each examination, ADC was measured in tumors  and normal gluteus muscles. Final tumor response as determined by change in tumor size or volume using MRI was correlated with tumor ADCs at each therapeutic time  or changes in tumor ADCs at mid-Tx. RESULTS: From pre-Tx to post-Tx, mean tumor ADCs were 0.88, 1.30, and 1.47 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s in sequence (P < 0.001), while those of normal gluteus muscles were 1.24, 1.29, and 1.21 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s in sequence (P > 0.05). At mid-Tx, tumor ADCs and changes in tumor ADCs had a significant correlation with final tumor size responses (P = 0.029 and 0.025, respectively). However, the tumor ADC values at pre-Tx were not associated with the final tumor size response (P = 0.47). The final tumor volume response was not associated with tumor ADC at pre-Tx or mid-Tx (P > 0.05) or changes in tumor ADCs at mid-Tx (P > 0.05).

Chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 1 (CXCR1) and CXCR2 play a key role in generation and regulation of CXC chemokine signaling. CXCR1 is a receptor for interleukin 8 (IL8), a pro-inflammatory chemokine, and CXCR1/2 are crucially involved in the prostate cancer development and progression. Thus, we generated a high-affinity human CXCR1/CXCR2 inhibitor, CXCL8 (3-72) K11R/G31P, named G31P, which is a synthetic derivative of the human cytokine, IL-8. In this study, we investigated  the effects of G31P on regulation of prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in  nude mouse xenografts. Cell viability, adhesion, and wound healing assays were used to assess the effects of G31P on growth, adhesion, and migration of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells in vitro, respectively. Nude mouse xenografts and xenograft implantation assays were performed to determine the effect of G31P on PC-3 cells in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect gene expression, and  fluorescence imaging was used to detect tumor volume and microvessel density in tumor xenografts. The data showed that G31P treatment significantly reduced PC-3  cell viability, adhesion and migration capacity in a dose-dependent manner (up to 100 ng/ml). Additionally, G31P treatment of nude mice suppressed the growth of orthotopically transplanted tumor xenografts. G31P also inhibited tumor tissue vascularization, which was associated with the decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappaB in orthotopic xenograft tissues. This study provides evidence that G31P, a CXCR1/2 inhibitor, may effectively control prostate cancer.',\n",

We report the first comprehensive field synopsis and creation of a parallel publicly available and regularly updated database (CRCgene) that catalogs all genetic association studies on colorectal cancer (http://www.chs.med.ed.ac.uk/CRCgene/). METHODS: We  performed two independent systematic reviews, reviewing 10&emsp14;145 titles, then collated and extracted data from 635 publications reporting on 445 polymorphisms in 110 different genes. We carried out meta-analyses to derive summary effect estimates for 92 polymorphisms in 64 different genes. For assessing the credibility of associations, we applied the Venice criteria and the Bayesian False Discovery Probability (BFDP) test. RESULTS: We consider 16 independent variants at 13 loci (MUTYH, MTHFR, SMAD7, and common variants tagging the loci 8q24, 8q23.3, 11q23.1, 14q22.2, 1q41, 20p12.3, 20q13.33, 3q26.2, 16q22.1, and 19q13.1) to have the most highly credible associations with colorectal cancer, with all variants except those in MUTYH and 19q13.1 reaching genome-wide statistical significance in at least one meta-analysis model. We identified less-credible (higher heterogeneity, lower statistical power, BFDP >0.2) associations with 23 more variants at 22 loci. The meta-analyses of a further 20 variants for which associations have previously been reported found no evidence to support these as true associations. CONCLUSION: The CRCgene database  provides the context for genetic association data to be interpreted appropriately and helps inform future research direction.',\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 1999 and December 2010, the records of 150 ADH lesions that had been biopsied were retrospectively reviewed. The biopsy  types included 11-gauge stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (SVAB) (n=102) and ultrasonography (US)-guided 14-gauge automated biopsy (n=48). The patients were divided into two groups: those who had cancer in the final pathology and those who did not. Variables associated with underestimation of ADH lesions were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The underestimation rates according to the  biopsy types were 41.7% (20/48) for the US-guided 14-gauge automated biopsy and 20.6% (21/102) for the 11-gauge SVAB (P = 0.007). The rate of underestimation was significantly higher in lesions greater than 7 mm than it was in smaller lesions, with both US-guided 14-gauge automated biopsy and 11-gauge SVAB (P = 0.024 and P  = 0.042, respectively). The rate of underestimation was significantly higher with the 11-gauge SVAB (P = 0.025) in lesions that were suspicious (R4) and highly suggestive of malignancy (R5) than in those that were probably benign (R3). CONCLUSION: The underestimation rate in ADH lesions was significantly higher with US-guided 14-gauge automated biopsy compared to the 11-gauge SVAB. The underestimation rate was also significantly higher in lesions greater than 7 mm regardless of the biopsy type, and in lesions biopsied using SVAB that were regarded as suspicious (R4) or highly suggestive of malignancy (R5) on imaging.',\n",

METHOD: From Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) responses collected  on 526 PCa patients, direct comparisons were made between the prevalence of the first two DSM-IV-TR symptoms of Major Depressive Episode. These symptoms were then tested for their predictive power on depression total score and Zung's criteria for 'clinically significant' depression. RESULTS: Mean scores for anhedonia were significantly higher than for depressed mood, and nearly 25 times  as many patients had a high score for anhedonia as for depressed mood. The same pattern of results was apparent for those patients who had clinically significant levels of depression. Anhedonia was a more powerful predictor of total SDS depression score for the entire sample as well as for those patients with more severe depression. CONCLUSION: Because the biological basis for anhedonia is different to that for depressed mood, treatment options also differ for patients  who show a preponderance of anhedonia in their depressive symptomatology.

METHODS: a community survey of 2,194 adults aged 40+ years in Busselton, Western Australia in 1978 with mortality follow-up to 2001. Cox regression models were used to investigate the relationships of haemoglobin as a continuous measure and anaemia by WHO criteria (women <12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l); men <13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l)) with all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. RESULTS: anaemia was predominantly mild (>10 g/dl) and normocytic. There was an increased risk of death from all causes and from cancer for men with low haemoglobin. Cancers were predominantly of the prostate and genito-urinary organs, and to a lesser extent the gastrointestinal tract. There was no increased risk of all cause or cancer death in women.

To obtain an integrated view of gene regulation in response to environmental and endogenous estrogens on a genome-wide scale, we performed ChIP-seq to identify estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1; previously estrogen receptor alpha) binding sites, and RNA-seq in endometrial cancer cells exposed to bisphenol A (BPA; found in plastics), genistein (GEN; found in soybean), or 17beta-estradiol (E2; an endogenous estrogen). GEN and BPA treatment induces thousands of ESR1 binding sites and >50 gene expression changes, representing a subset of E2-induced gene regulation changes. Genes affected by E2 were highly enriched for ribosome-associated proteins; however, GEN and BPA failed to regulate most ribosome-associated proteins and instead enriched for transporters  of carboxylic acids. Treatment-dependent changes in gene expression were associated with treatment-dependent ESR1 binding sites, with the exception that many genes up-regulated by E2 harbored a BPA-induced ESR1 binding site but failed to show any expression change after BPA treatment. GEN and BPA exhibited a similar relationship to E2 in the breast cancer line T-47D, where cell type specificity played a much larger role than treatment specificity.

Bootstrap technique for variable selection and bootstrap resampling to test selection stability were used. Regarding AGS subtypes, HER-2 and basal were more likely to  recur than luminal A and B subtypes, while patients in the basal group were more  likely to have CBC. However, considering PFs along with AGS subtypes, the optimal multivariable predictive model for DR consisted of age, T, N, G and ER.

Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is thought to be the most important chemokine for recruitment of macrophages to the tumor microenvironment. However, its role on tumorigenesis in a genetic mouse model of colon cancer has not been explored. We examined the role of MCP-1 on tumor-associated macrophages, inflammation, and intestinal tumorigenesis. Male Apc(Min/+), Apc(Min/+)/MCP-1(-/-) or wild-type mice were euthanized at 18 wk of age and intestines were analyzed for polyp burden, apoptosis, proliferation, beta-catenin, macrophage number and phenotype, markers for cytotoxic T lymphocytes and regulatory T cells, and inflammatory mediators. MCP-1 deficiency  decreased overall polyp number by 20% and specifically large polyp number by 45%  (P < 0.05). This was consistent with an increase in apoptotic cells (P < 0.05), but there was no change detected in proliferation or beta-catenin. MCP-1 deficiency decreased F4/80-positive cells in both the polyp tissue and surrounding intestinal tissue (P < 0.05) as well as expression of markers associated with M1 (IL-12 and IL-23) and M2 macrophages (IL-13, CD206, TGF-beta,  and CCL17) (P < 0.05). MCP-1 knockout was also associated with increased cytotoxic T lymphocytes and decreased regulatory T cells (P < 0.05). In addition, MCP-1(-/-) offset the increased mRNA expression of IL-1beta and IL-6 in intestinal tissue and IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in polyp tissue (P < 0.05), and prevented the decrease in SOCS1 expression (P < 0.05).

Upon ligand binding, the AR binds to  thousands of genomic loci and activates a cell-type specific gene program. Prostate cancer growth and progression depend on androgen-induced AR signaling. Treatment of advanced prostate cancer through medical or surgical castration leads to initial response and durable remission, but resistance inevitably develops. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), AR activity remains critical for tumor growth despite androgen deprivation. Although previous studies have focused on ligand-dependent AR signaling, in this study we explore AR function under the androgen-deprived conditions characteristic of CRPC. Our data  demonstrate that AR persistently occupies a distinct set of genomic loci after androgen deprivation in CRPC. These androgen-independent AR occupied regions have constitutively open chromatin structures that lack the canonical androgen response element and are independent of FoxA1, a transcription factor involved in ligand-dependent AR targeting. Many AR binding events occur at proximal promoters, which can act as enhancers to augment transcriptional activities of other promoters through DNA looping. We further show that androgen-independent AR binding directs a gene expression program in CRPC, which is necessary for the growth of CRPC after androgen withdrawal.',\n",

Information on sexual activity and cervical samples for HPV DNA detection using Roche Linear Array were collected semiannually for two years from 700 women ages 35 to 60 years. Incidence and potential fraction of HPV associated with new and lifetime sexual partnerships were estimated using Poisson regression. Cox frailty models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for potential risk factors of incident HPV detection. Recent and lifetime numbers of sexual partners were both strongly  associated with incident HPV detection. However, only 13% of incident detections  were attributed to new sexual partners, whereas 72% were attributed to 5 or more  lifetime sexual partners. Furthermore, 155 of 183 (85%) incident HPV detections occurred during periods of sexual abstinence or monogamy, and were strongly associated with cumulative lifetime sexual exposure [HR: 4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-8.4). This association increased with increasing age. These data challenge the paradigm that incident HPV detection is driven by current sexual behavior and new viral acquisition in older women. Our observation that most incident HPV infection was attributable to past, not current, sexual behavior at older ages supports a natural history model of viral latency and reactivation. As the more highly exposed baby-boomer generation of women with sexual debut after the sexual revolution transition to menopause, the implications of HPV reactivation at older ages on cervical cancer risk and screening recommendations should be carefully evaluated.',\n",

Aberrant activation of FGFR3 via overexpression or mutation is a frequent feature of bladder cancer; however, its molecular and cellular consequences and functional relevance to carcinogenesis are not well understood. Through transcriptional profiling of bladder carcinoma cells subjected to short hairpin RNA knockdown of FGFR3, we identified a gene-signature linking FGFR3 signaling with de novo sterol and lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. We found that FGFR3 signaling promotes the cleavage and activation of the master transcriptional regulator of lipogenesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP1/SREBF1), in a PI3K-mTORC1-dependent fashion. In turn, SREBP1 regulates the expression of key lipogenic enzymes, including stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1/SCD). SCD1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids and is crucial for lipid homeostasis. In human bladder cancer cell lines expressing constitutively active FGFR3, knockdown of SCD1 by siRNA markedly attenuated cell-cycle progression, reduced proliferation,  and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inducible knockdown of SCD1 in a bladder cancer xenograft model substantially inhibited tumor progression. Pharmacologic inhibition of SCD1 blocked fatty acid desaturation and also exerted antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of FGFR3 in regulating lipid metabolism to maintain tumor growth and survival, and also identify SCD1 as a potential therapeutic target for FGFR3-driven bladder cancer.',\n",

We report an audit of our experience with the GnRH agonist, goserelin (Zoladex(R)), used with chemotherapy to preserve ovarian function and maintain fertility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pre-menopausal women were given goserelin subcutaneously every 28 days during chemotherapy, starting 0-14 days before treatment. The main clinical end point was recovery of menstruation after chemotherapy. The other end points were  rate of successful conception and median time to recovery of menses. RESULTS: About 84% of 125 women recovered menstruation with the median time to recovery of 6 months (1-43 months), including 76% of 71 patients aged over 35. Of the 42 patients who attempted pregnancy, 71% (n=30) managed to achieve pregnancies. At the time of analysis, there were 42 pregnancies and 30 healthy deliveries.

This interaction enables adhesion of leukocytes and cancer cells to endothelial cells within capillaries, resulting in their extravasation into tissues. The last step in sLe(X) biosynthesis is the  alpha1,3-fucosyltrasferase (FUT)-catalyzed transfer of an L-fucose residue to carbohydrate acceptors. Impairing FUT activity compromises leukocyte homing to sites of inflammation and renders cancer cells less malignant. Inhibition of FUTs is, consequently, of great interest, but efforts to generate glycosyltransferase  inhibitors, including FUT inhibitors, has proven challenging. Here we describe a  metabolic engineering strategy to inhibit the biosynthesis of sLe(X) in cancer cells using peracetylated 5-thio-L-fucose (5T-Fuc). We show that 5T-Fuc is taken  up by cancer cells and then converted into a sugar nucleotide analog, GDP-5T-Fuc, that blocks FUT activity and limits sLe(X) presentation on HepG2 cells with an EC(50) in the low micromolar range. GDP-5T-Fuc itself does not get transferred by either FUT3 or FUT7 at a measurable rate. We further demonstrate that treatment of cells with 5T-Fuc impaired their adhesive properties to immobilized adhesion molecules and human endothelial cells. 5T-Fuc, therefore, is a useful probe that  can be used to modulate sLe(X) levels in cells to evaluate the consequences of inhibiting FUT-mediated sLe(X) formation. These data also reveal the utility of using sugar analogues that lead to formation of donor substrate analogues within  cells as a general approach to blocking glycosyltransferases in cells.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: This investigation sought to evaluate a papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patient's  risk of distant metastasis. DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis. SETTING: The setting was a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Included were 972 PTC patients. INTERVENTION: The intervention was compartment-oriented surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was lung, bone, and liver metastasis. RESULTS: Eighty-seven (9.0%) of the 972 PTC patients had distant metastases to lung (79 patients), bone (16 patients), liver (two patients), brain and skin (one patient each). For distant metastasis, more than 20 lymph node metastases had a specificity of 90.8% and a negative predictive value of 92.7%, whereas sensitivity and positive predictive value were low (27.6 and 22.9%). On multivariate logistic regression, 1-5, 6-10, and 11-20 involved nodes denoted a moderate risk of lung metastasis [odds ratio (OR), 9.9, 10.6, and 13.8; P </= 0.004], whereas more than 20 involved nodes indicated a high risk of lung metastasis (OR, 25.0; P < 0.001). Mediastinal lymph node metastasis carried a moderate risk of lung metastasis (OR, 7.5; P = 0.001). When these numeric categories of lymph node metastases were exchanged for current tumor node metastasis (TNM) N categories, the OR decreased from 25.0 (for > 20 lymph node metastases) to 16.4 (N1b), and from 9.9-13.8 (for 1-20 lymph node metastases) to  4.7 (N1a).

METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with obstructing esophageal cancer were enrolled in this study. Each subject had dysphagia, and nine could not swallow fluid. External beam radiotherapy or a self-expandable metal stent was used following PDT for dysphagia due to recurrence of the malignancy. RESULTS: At 4 weeks post-PDT, a significant improvement in the dysphagia score was observed in 90% of patients, from 2.75 +/- 0.91 to 1.05 +/- 0.83 (p < 0.05). Patients with recurrent dysphagia underwent stent insertion at an average of 63 days (range, 37 to 90). The rate of major complications was 10%. Two esophageal strictures occurred, which were treated by  placement of a modified expandable stent across the stricture. The median survival in these cases was 7.0 +/- 0.6 months. One patient that was treated with PDT and radiotherapy is alive and showed a complete tumor response. CONCLUSIONS:  PDT as a multimodality treatment is safe and effective for relieving malignant esophageal obstruction with minimal complications.',\n",

In Korea, health insurance has covered HOT since November 1, 2006. The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical features of patients who used long-term HOT due to chronic respiratory failure and to determine the appropriateness of oxygen prescriptions. METHODS: Between November 2006 and April 2010, patients prescribed long-term HOT were enrolled in  the study at a tertiary university referral hospital and their medical records and telephone survey information were evaluated. In total, 340 patients were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Regarding the initial indications for HOT, their mean PaO(2) was 49.8 mmHg and mean SpO(2) was 82.2%. Underlying diseases included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 19.8%), lung cancer (12.6%), and interstitial lung disease (11.2%). The admission rate within 1 year  was 53.4% and the average number of admissions was 1.64/patient. Other underlying diseases for which oxygen was prescribed, despite not meeting the insurance coverage criteria, were lung cancer (36.6%) and interstitial pneumonia (16.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Home oxygen prescriptions have increased since health insurance coverage was extended. However, cases of oxygen prescriptions frequently do not meet the coverage criteria. It is important to discuss extending the coverage criteria to other disease groups, such as interstitial lung disease and lung cancer, in terms of cost-effectiveness.

Unlike conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NO-aspirin seems to be free of adverse effects while retaining the beneficial activities of its parent compound. The effect of NO-aspirin on pancreatic carcinogenesis was investigated by assessing the development of precursor pancreatic lesions and adenocarcinomas in Kras(G12D/+) transgenic mice that recapitulate human pancreatic cancer progression. Six-week-old male p48(Cre/+)-LSL-Kras(G12D/+) transgenic mice (20 per group) were fed diets containing 0, 1000, or 2000 ppm NO-aspirin. The development of pancreatic tumors  was monitored by positron emission tomography imaging. All mice were killed at the age of 41 weeks and assessed for pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and for molecular changes in the tumors. Our results reveal that NO-aspirin at 1000 and 2000 ppm significantly suppressed pancreatic tumor weights, PDAC incidence, and carcinoma in situ (PanIN-3 lesions). The degree of inhibition of PanIN-3 and carcinoma was more pronounced with NO-aspirin at 1000 ppm (58.8% and 48%, respectively) than with 2000 ppm (47% and 20%, respectively). NO-aspirin at 1000 ppm significantly inhibited the spread of carcinoma in the pancreas ( approximately 97%; P < .0001). Decreased expression of cyclooxygenase (COX; with approximately 42% inhibition of total COX activity), inducible nitric oxide synthase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, and beta-catenin was observed, with induction of p21, p38, and p53 in the pancreas of NO-aspirin-treated mice.

The centrosome normally duplicates precisely once before mitosis in a process that is extensively regulated by protein degradation including SKP1-Cullin 1 (CUL1)-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The core SCF component CUL1 has recently been found to be required to suppress the formation of supernumerary centrosomes and centrioles, the core-forming units of centrosomes. Here, we identify the CUL1-interacting protein cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1)  as a novel centrosomal protein with a role in centriole duplication control. CAND1 was found to synergize with Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a master regulator of centriole biogenesis, in the induction of centriole overduplication. We provide evidence that CAND1 functions in this process by increasing PLK4 protein  stability. Furthermore, mutants of CUL1 that lack the ability to interact with CAND1 and are unable to assemble functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes were impaired in their ability to restrain aberrant daughter centriole synthesis. To corroborate a role of CAND1 in human carcinogenesis, we analyzed a series of prostate adenocarcinomas and found altered expression of CAND1 on the mRNA or protein level in 52.9% and 40.8%, respectively, of the tumor samples analyzed. These results highlight the role of altered SCF components in cancer in general and encourage further studies to explore the SCF-CAND1 axis for the development of novel predictive biomarkers and therapeutic approaches in prostate cancer.',\n",

Survival of a fraction of tumor cells and development of chemoresistance may be influenced by an initial cellular stress response against the administered xenobiotics. Therefore, we compared the short-term effects of cisplatin and non-cross-resistant bis-[(p-methoxybenzyl)cyclopentadienyl] titanium(IV) dichloride (Titanocene Y) on phosphorylation of 46 sites of a total of 38 signaling proteins in tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53)-wild-type NCI-H526 SCLC cells. The functional significance of selected kinases for the cytotoxicity of both drugs was tested using specific inhibitors and an activator. The cisplatin-induced cellular stress response involved activation of p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas Titanocene Y-triggered signaling affected c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase alpha1 (AMPKalpha1) was increased by both drugs, which promoted cell survival, as indicated by results obtained using AMPK inhibitor compound C and AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-d-ribofuranoside. This is in good agreement with previous reports, where AMPKalpha1 was demonstrated to represent an important factor for the sensitivity  to cisplatin in colon and ovarian cancers, most likely by induction of autophagy.

Assessment of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and Akt phosphorylation and of CAV-1 and cyclin D1 protein expression was performed by ELISA. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) gemcitabine was compared against metronomic doses of the ceramide analogs by evaluating the inhibition of MIA PaCa-2 subcutaneous tumor growth in nude mice. RESULTS: Metronomic ceramide analogs preferentially inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in endothelial cells. Low concentrations of  AL6 and C2 caused a significant inhibition of HUVEC migration. ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation were significantly decreased after metronomic ceramide analog treatment. Such treatment caused the overexpression of CAV-1 and TSP-1 mRNAs and  proteins in endothelial cells, whereas cyclin D1 protein levels were reduced. The antiangiogenic and antitumor impact in vivo of metronomic C2 and AL6 regimens was similar to that caused by MTD gemcitabine.

In the present study, we  investigated the effects of the epigenetic modulator apicidin in combination with the cytotoxic agent docetaxel in tumor breast cell lines characterized by different grades of invasiveness. We report that combined treatment of apicidin and docetaxel, at low toxicity doses, stimulates in metastatic breast cancer cells the expression of CTCF-like protein and other cancer antigens, thus potentially favoring an antitumor immune response. In addition, apicidin and docetaxel co-treatment specifically stimulates apoptosis, characterized by an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-8 activation. Importantly, following combined exposure to these agents, metastatic cells were also found to induce signals of immunogenic apoptosis such as cell surface expression of calreticulin  and release of considerable amounts of high-mobility group box 1 protein, thus potentially promoting the translation of induced cell death into antitumor immune response.

The high rates and patterns of therapeutic failure seen in patients are consistent with a steady accumulation of drug-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). This study demonstrates that the Notch signaling pathway and Notch3 in particular are critical for the regulation of CSCs and tumor resistance to platinum. We show that Notch3 overexpression in tumor cells results in expansion of CSCs and increased platinum chemoresistance.  In contrast, gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), a Notch pathway inhibitor, depletes CSCs and increases tumor sensitivity to platinum. Similarly, a Notch3 siRNA knockdown increases the response to platinum therapy, further demonstrating that  modulation of tumor chemosensitivity by GSI is Notch specific. Most importantly,  the cisplatin/GSI combination is the only treatment that effectively eliminates both CSCs and the bulk of tumor cells, indicating that a dual combination targeting both populations is needed for tumor eradication. In addition, we found that the cisplatin/GSI combination therapy has a synergistic cytotoxic effect in  Notch-dependent tumor cells by enhancing the DNA-damage response, G(2)/M cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Based on these results, we conclude that targeting the Notch pathway could significantly increase tumor sensitivity to platinum therapy. Our study suggests important clinical applications for targeting Notch as part of novel treatment strategies upon diagnosis of ovarian cancer and at recurrence. Both platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive relapses may benefit from such an approach as clinical data suggest that all relapses after platinum therapy are increasingly platinum resistant.',\n",

We report that hyperploid cancer cells become immunogenic because of a constitutive  endoplasmic reticulum stress response resulting in the aberrant cell surface exposure of calreticulin. Hyperploid, calreticulin-exposing cancer cells readily  proliferated in immunodeficient mice and conserved their increased DNA content. In contrast, hyperploid cells injected into immunocompetent mice generated tumors only after a delay, and such tumors exhibited reduced DNA content, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and calreticulin exposure.

As PC was only recently introduced to oncology practice in Qatar and the region, raising awareness among physicians  is crucial. This survey study is designed to outline the level of awareness and knowledge of oncologists in Qatar toward PC. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey study, copies of a self-constructed questionnaire were distributed to 49 physicians at the National Center for Cancer Care and Research in Qatar during January 2012 and collected for data analysis. RESULTS: The physician response rate was 100%. Less than half of the responders (36.7%) had official training in  PC, but the majority (89.8%) showed interest in the field. Only 57.8% of the physicians reported self-competence in providing good PC to the dying patient. On the other hand, up to 69.4% are aware of the guidelines for pain relief and 58.7% apply them in their clinical practice. The concept of PC hospice was familiar to  77.1% of participants. On one hand, 85.7% of the physicians advocated that every  medical center should have PC service, while up to 70.8% preferred that patients  with short survival expectancy die in the community, rather than in a hospital setting. CONCLUSIONS: There is relatively good awareness and knowledge among health care providers specialized in cancer treatment in our hospital, despite the lack of formal training. Further training and informative sessions are required to raise awareness among oncologists and encourage utilization of PC services and thus optimize patient accessibility to PC.',\n",

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Forty-five patients - 18 months to 18 years of life, were included (20 - organ recipients, 14- anti-tumour chemotherapy, 11 - control group). Clinical, oral mucosa examination focused on the type, severity and site of lesions, and microbiology assessed the presence of bacteria and fungi in the material from lesions. Blood cultures were performed in ten immunocompromised patients with manifestations of systemic infection. The control material consisted of blood cultures made prior to the onset of oral lesions and after 4-6 weeks following their remission in a diagnosed bacteremia. The statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: In the subjects with secondary immunodeficiency, among other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), Candidia spp. were more frequent. In cancer patients, mucositis was associated with Candida spp., Streptococcus spp. Organ recipients with stomatitis exhibited the presence of CoNS, Streptococcus viridians and other. Oral lesions in the control group contained Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Neisseria spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. In 30% of immunocompromised patients, oral lesions were accompanied by bacteremia.

The developing countries are catching up with this trend. Breast ultrasound when properly performed and interpreted, is an indispensable tool in breast imaging. The early diagnosis and treatment of breast masses reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with delayed diagnosis of breast carcinoma. The use of breast ultrasound is gaining ground in recent time,  this is due to current advances in ultrasound technology which permit greater spatial and contrast resolution and shortened scan time. OBJECTIVE: To determine  the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of ultrasound in the detection of palpable breast masses and to correlate the findings of ultrasound with the findings of fine needle aspiration cytology, or histopathology. METHODS: Breast ultrasound scanning was done in 100 patients with signs and symptoms of breast lesion referred from the Surgical out Patient Clinic to the Radiodiagnosis Department of Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). Histology reports were collected from either the case note or Morbid Anatomy department to correlate the findings with ultrasound diagnosis. RESULTS: The mean age was 41.7 +/- 11.34 (18-59) years. Symptoms of breast lesion were highest in the age group 41-50 years 38 (38%), and least in 18-20 years 4 (4%). When the use of ultrasonography  was compared with the histopathology report in the diagnosis of breast lesion in  the studied population, the sensitivity was 100%, specificity (96.6%), accuracy (97%), posting predictive value (PPV) 81.3%, and negative predictive value (NPV)  100%. The accuracy, specificity and PPV however decreased with increasing age. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography of the breast is useful in the diagnosis of breast lesions, because of the high sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic value it exhibited with histopathologic findings.',\n",

Population-based cancer registries can augment this research by providing more clinical detail and long-term follow-up information than is typically available from biospecimen annotations. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we performed a pilot linkage between the California Cancer Registry (CCR) and the University of California, Davis Cancer Center Biorepository (UCD CCB) databases to determine if we could identify patients with records in both databases. METHODS: We performed a probabilistic data linkage between 2180 UCD CCB biospecimen records collected during the years 2005-2009 and all CCR records for  cancers diagnosed from 1988-2009 based on standard data linkage procedures. RESULTS: The 1040 UCD records with a unique medical record number, tissue site, and pathology date were linked to 3.3 million CCR records. Of these, 844 (81.2%)  were identified in both databases. Overall, record matches were highest (100%) for cancers of the cervix and testis/other male genital system organs. For the most common cancers, matches were highest for cancers of the lung and respiratory system (93%), breast (91.7%), and colon and rectum (89.5%), and lower for prostate (72.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot linkage demonstrated that information on existing biospecimens from a cancer center biorepository can be linked successfully to cancer registry data.

METHODOLOGY: This was an ecologic study. Mortality due to cervical cancer was estimated from data collected between 2005 and 2008 by the Colombian National Statistics Bureau (DANE).This included overall mortality in Colombia, mortality by department and mortality by rural and urban area. DANE provided the  under-recording indicator for mortality by departments and the unmet basic needs  index. Spearman correlation coefficient was estimated for average mortality by department, unmet basic needs and under-recording variables. RESULTS: The overall annual mortality rate from 2005 to 2008 due to cervical cancer in Colombia ranged from 10 to 11.1 per 100,000 females. Mortality reported in urban areas was higher than in rural areas (10.3-11.7 cf 7.6-8.7). The lowest average mortality was reported from the Choco department (4.7) and the highest from Meta (18.2). An inverse correlation was found between average mortality by department and unmet basic needs. The 'under-reporting' indicator had an inverse correlation with mortality, meaning that departments having recording issues also reported lower mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Health systems must adopt strategies designed to improve information systems for supporting decision-making and optimise the use of health resources, particularly for vulnerable populations and populations having unmet basic needs. Comparing mortality amongst departments and areas will  not lead to reliable conclusions in such under-recording conditions.\",\n",

Our results show that RV metabolites have an antioxidant  activity similar to that RV. Moreover, all metabolites inhibited cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner as well as [(3)H] thymidine incorporation. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the percentage of cell in G0/G1 phase induced by RV metabolite treatments, as well as the induction of apoptosis. On the basis of our results we propose, for the first time, that RV metabolites remain active after their biosynthesis, contributing to the health benefits attributed previously only to RV.

METHODS: Using the quantitative four diagnosis and syndrome differentiation methods, 60 normal mice and 190 H22 liver cancer bearing mice were syndrome typed. Serum corticosterone and aldosterone were tested by ELISA, and mRNA expressions of cytokines in the adrenal gland were detected using Real-time PCR.  RESULTS: Mice of different syndromes were obtained, such as normal mice of no syndrome, normal mice of vigorous qi syndrome, normal mice of qi deficiency syndrome, liver cancer bearing mice of excessive evil toxic syndrome, liver cancer bearing mice of evil lying in the middle syndrome, liver cancer bearing mice of weak evil toxic syndrome, and liver cancer bearing mice of poisonous pathogenic factors and qi deficiency syndrome. The serum corticosteroids were significantly higher in the liver cancer bearing mice than in the normal mice (P  < 0.05). The cortex hormones increased most significantly in the liver cancer bearing mice of excessive evil toxic syndrome (P < 0.05). Compared with the normal mice, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12alpha, IL-12beta, and TNF-alpha gene expressions increased in the liver cancer bearing mice, while only expressions of IL-1alpha and IL-5 decreased. But the expressions of IL-13 and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) showed no regularity. The expressions of IL-4 and INF-alpha were not detected in all mice. It is notable that the more severe degree of poisonous pathogenic factors, the higher the expressions of serum corticosterone and aldosterone levels as well as IL-6, the lower expressions of IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-5, IL-12alpha, IL-12beta, and TNF-alpha.  CONCLUSIONS: The increased serum corticosteroid level in liver cancer bearing mice could possibly be induced by chronic tumor stress, partial cytokines were involved in the synthesis and secretion of the adrenal hormone.

It has been estimated that late menopause may be responsible for the occurrence of even 16% of cases of ovarian cancer in the population. The incidence of ovarian cancer is also higher  among nulliparous women, and among those who rarely become pregnant. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was analysis of the effect of reproductive factors on  the risk of ovarian cancer. METHODOLOGY: The study covered healthy women, without the diagnosis of focal lesions in the ovaries, and women with the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. The study was conducted during the period from September 2007-November 2011, and covered a total number of 1,346 women. Odds ratio was calculated for individual risk factors. Statistical analysis was performed by means of the statistical packages STATISTICA v8, GrafPad Instat v 3.00, Analyse-it v. 2.2, and Cytel Studio StatXact-8. Statistical hypothesis were verified on the level of significance p </= 0.05. RESULTS: Among females who began menstruating by the age of 11, the risk of ovarian cancer was 1.6 higher than among those in whom the first period occurred at the age of over 13. Similarly, among women who menstruated at the age of over 55 the risk of development of ovarian cancer was 1.4 times higher. The age at which a woman delivered her first live baby is also of importance. In the group of women who gave birth at the age of over 35, the risk was elevated and remained on the level of OR=1.7; 95%CI 0.66-4.5, compared to those who bore the first baby under the age of 25. If the pregnancy was terminated with miscarriage, the risk of contracting ovarian cancer decreases, and was on the level of OR=0.8; 95%CI 0.53-1.28, compared to the women who have never been pregnant. Among patients who did not breastfeed their babies, ovarian cancer risk was 1.7 times higher, compared to those breastfeeding.

The highest incidence of the disease is  registered among women aged 50 and more. Cancer imposes a considerable psychological strain on a woman. It causes a sense of uncertainty about one's health and further life, as well as frequent problems with accepting the image of one's own body. It often results in low self-esteem and a feeling of embarrassment, accompanied by symptoms of apathy and detachment. The aim of the study was to determine mental and social life quality of Polish women treated for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research encompassed 107 women aged between 45 and 65 (SD=6.11) undergoing treatment for breast cancer. The WHOQOL-Bref scale was applied in the research. RESULTS: The social field was better evaluated in comparison with the mental sphere. There was a statistical correlation between place of residence and social sphere of quality of life (p=,036), with higher ratings assigned by respondents residing in rural areas (M=15.36) compared with residents of towns (M=14.15). CONCLUSIONS: Given the fact that respondents were coping with cancer or its consequences, paradoxically, perception of the overall quality of life and examined areas was generally good,  especially among women with higher education, those who were single and those living in rural areas. Along with age, there decreases at the respondents the experienced quality of life, however a rise of evaluations of the mental sphere is accompanying the rise in the education level.\",\n",

In order to lower the risk of such complications, patients should take special care of their oral hygiene. The  aim of this study was to assess the oral hygiene status in children with ALL during anti-cancer treatment protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 78 children with ALL who were examined in 3 stages, and 78 generally healthy children, who constituted the control group, participated in the study. In the group of patients were 55 children from the rural environment and 23 children living in towns. Oral hygiene status was assessed with the use of the Oral Hygiene Simplified Index, Plaque Index, and Gingival Index. RESULTS: The average value of OHI-S index in children with ALL before the chemotherapy was 0.64 +/- 0.85, the value of the Pl.I index was 0.59 +/- 0.74, GI index value was 0.08 +/- 0.34. In the period from 0.5-1.5 years, the anti-cancer therapy value indicators of oral hygiene in children with ALL developed as follows: OHI-S--0.49 +/- 0.69, Pl.I--0.49 +/- 0.67, GI--0.02 +/- 0.13. CONCLUSIONS: Oral hygiene was significantly better in children with ALL than in children in the control group.  The better condition of oral hygiene in children with ALL than children in the control group is the result of the oral hygiene regime that the children were following during cancer treatment protocols. Significantly higher GI in children  with ALL, compared to children from the control group, was observed despite the better oral hygiene.',\n",

AIM: The study's aim was to determine whether spiritual  well-being is correlated with HrQoL and whether participants' age, sex, marital status, site of cancer, and stage of disease are related to spiritual well-being. DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 159 Arabic-speaking, study-eligible cancer patients who were in treatment at the King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC), Amman, Jordan, completed three questionnaires: a demographic questionnaire; the Functional Assessment in Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), which assesses the physical, social, functional, and emotional domains of HrQoL;  and the Functional Assessment in Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-being (FACIT-Sp). RESULTS: Physical well-being was negatively correlated with the FACIT-Sp for men, divorced, and stage IV disease.

AIM: To quantify the incidence of SPC in patients with MPM, with the aim of possibly developing further preventive measures. METHODS: In a retrospective study, 76 patients with  MPM were identified from 2155 patients being followed up at our unit. RESULTS: Of the 76 patients, 12 (16%) developed another neoplasm, with 59% of them having nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and 41% other noncutaneous cancers. By contrast,  only 8% of those with single primary melanoma had other neoplasms (21% of whom had NMSC). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MPM, especially men with skin phototype II, have a significantly increased incidence of developing SPC, particularly NMSC.

RESULTS: Among 991 randomly assigned patients, median progression-free survival as assessed by independent review was 9.6 months with T-DM1 versus 6.4 months with lapatinib plus capecitabine (hazard ratio for progression or death from any  cause, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.77; P<0.001), and median overall survival at the second interim analysis crossed the stopping boundary for efficacy (30.9 months vs. 25.1 months; hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.85; P<0.001). The objective response rate was higher with T-DM1 (43.6%, vs. 30.8% with lapatinib plus capecitabine; P<0.001); results for all additional secondary end points favored T-DM1. Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse  events were higher with lapatinib plus capecitabine than with T-DM1 (57% vs. 41%). The incidences of thrombocytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase levels were higher with T-DM1, whereas the incidences of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were higher with lapatinib plus capecitabine. CONCLUSIONS: T-DM1 significantly prolonged progression-free and overall survival with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients  with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.

       " '23020209': {'AB': 'OBJECT: Surgery for spinal metastasis is considered palliative, and postoperative survival is often less than a year. Recurrence of metastatic lesions is quite common, and it remains unclear whether repeat surgery is effective. In this study, the authors assessed independent predictors for survival at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery, and examined whether repeat surgery for recurrence of spinal metastasis influenced survival rates. METHODS: Retrospective review of the electronic medical records was performed to identify a consecutive  population of adult patients who underwent surgery for spinal metastasis during the period 2005-2011. Utilizing a Cox proportional hazard regression model, the authors assessed independent predictors and risk factors for survival at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. In addition, the impact of repeat surgery on survival was specifically assessed via multivariable analysis. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were included in the final analysis. The overall  mean postoperative duration of survival was 9.6 months. In addition to previously identified predictors of survival (preoperative ambulation, Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS], radiotherapy, primary cancer type, presence of extraspinal metastasis, and number of spinal segments with metastasis), pain on presentation  and body mass index (BMI) of 25-30 were both independently associated with survival. Patients with recurrence who underwent repeat surgery had longer mean survival times than patients with recurrence who did not undergo repeat surgery (19.6 months vs 12.8 months, respectively). Repeat surgery was also independently associated with higher survival rates on multivariate analysis. Follow-up KPS was significantly higher in patients who underwent repeat surgery as well. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to confirming previously identified predictors of survival following surgery for spinal metastasis, the authors identified BMI and  pain on presentation as independent predictors of survival. They also found that  repeat surgery may be a viable option in patients with metastatic recurrence and  may offer prolonged survival, likely due to improved functionality, mitigating complications associated with immobility.',\n",

ECMS inhibited significantly the survival rates of SGC7901 and MKN-28 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners by MTT assay. The typical apoptotic morphological changes were observed by Hoechst 33258 dye assay  after SGC7901 and MKN-28 cells were treated with ECMS for 48 h. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that ECMS-treatment blocked the cells at the S phase of cell cycle. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Bcl-2 were downregulated notably by ECMS-treatment, whereas those of Fas/Fas-associated death domain, p53, and Bax were upregulated in SGC7901 cells.  ECMS dramatically enhanced the enzymatic activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 whilst slightly increased caspase-8 activity.

Knowing that, adipokines could regulate insulin resistance, inflammation, immunity and carcinogenesis. Accordingly, an understanding of adipokines in relation to pancreatic cancer could be useful to improve disease outcome. We aimed to determine serum retinol binding protein-4 (RBP-4) and neutophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in pancreatic cancer patients. Moreover, we assessed their association with tumor severity and with each other. METHODS: A total of 23 pancreatic cancer patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. Fifteen of the pancreatic cancer patients underwent Whipple resection and were examined before and after operation. Serum glucose, insulin, lipid profile, CA19-9, RBP-4 and NGAL were estimated by ELISA. RESULTS:  Significant elevation in serum concentrations of RBP-4 (64.4 +/- 5.6 ng/ml) and NGAL (142(80-235) ng/ml) at p < 0.001 was found in pancreatic cancer patients. Both RBP-4 and NGAL were significantly lower after operation than before operation. Moreover, NGAL was elevated in advanced pathological T stage. Interestingly, RBP-4 and NGAL levels were positively correlated (r = 0.484, p = 0.05) and they are associated with some of the lipid profile parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum RBP-4 and NGAL are associated with pancreatic cancer. They were positively interrelated; highlighting the possible interplay between them in pancreatic cancer.',\n",

In the setting of de novo MBC, large registry analyses cite positive temporal trends in  survival, but the extent to which advances in systemic therapy have contributed to these gains is not clear. METHODS: The City of Hope Cancer Registry was used to identify a consecutive series of patients with de novo MBC who received their  first line of therapy between 1985 and 2004. Comprehensive clinicopathologic and  treatment-related data were collected for each patient. Univariate analyses were  conducted via Cox regression to identify factors associated with improved survival. Multivariate analysis was also conducted via Cox regression and the stepwise procedure was used to identify independent predictors of survival. RESULTS: A total of 324 patients with de novo MBC were identified. After application of exclusion criteria, including the sole presence of supraclavicular node metastasis, 274 patients were retained in the analysis. The treatment-related characteristics associated with improved survival included: use of endocrine therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95%CI 0.47-0.77; P<0.0001), and addition of bisphosphonates (HR 0.70, 95%CI 0.52-0.96; P=0.02). However, recipients of novel cytotoxic agents (defined as drugs approved for MBC since 1994) had no improvement in survival relative to patients treated with older cytotoxic agents. On multivariate analysis, age (< 50), receipt of aromatase inhibitors, and receipt of zoledronic acid were independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival of women with de novo metastatic breast cancer has improved over the past 20 years.

A total of 115 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer were enrolled in the thoracic section of the Tangdu Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University from April 2008 to April 2009. Clinical parameters of patients, the morbidity, and the mortality following esophageal resection were recorded and compared. After the surgery, a 2-year follow up was completed. It was found that recurrent  laryngeal nerve paralysis and postoperative pneumonia were more frequently diagnosed in the patients that did not receive continuous recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring (6/61 vs. 0/54). Furthermore, positive mediastinal lymph nodes (P = 0.015), total mediastinal lymph nodes (P < 0.001), positive total lymph nodes (P = 0.027), and total lymph nodes (P < 0.001) were more often surgically removed in the patients with continuous recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring.

The frequency with which confirmatory endoscopy changed surveillance management in patients with newly diagnosed BE was assessed. A two center cohort analysis was conducted on patients newly diagnosed  with BE. The rate of dysplasia on confirmatory endoscopy for patients who had nondysplastic BE was obtained. Demographic and endoscopic variables were assessed for association with dysplasia detection using Firth logistic regression model. Out of the 146 patients newly diagnosed with BE and initially determined to be without dysplasia, 12 had dysplasia on the confirmatory second EGD (8.2%). Eleven of 12 cases with dysplasia on confirmatory endoscopy had long-segment BE (LSBE).  Among all the LSBE cases in our cohort, 11 had newly diagnosed dysplasia on confirmatory EGD, 29.7% (11/37).

We have previously shown in haematological (multiple myeloma) and solid tumours (ovarian cancer) that clinical sensitivity to such agents can result from a defect in DNA ICL processing leading to their persistence. Conversely, enhanced repair can result in clinical acquired resistance following chemotherapy. The repair of ICLs is complex but it is assumed that the 'unhooking' step is common to all ICLs. METHODS: Using a modification of the single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay we measured the formation and unhooking of melphalan and cisplatin-induced ICLs in cell lines and clinical samples. DNA damage response in the form of gamma-H2AX foci formation and the formation of RAD51 foci as a marker of homologous recombination were also determined. Real-time PCR of 84 genes involved in DNA damage signalling pathways was also examined pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: Plasma cells from multiple myeloma patients known to be  clinically resistant to melphalan showed significant unhooking of melphalan-induced ICLs at 48 hours, but did not unhook cisplatin-induced ICLs. In ovarian cancer cells obtained from patients following platinum-based chemotherapy, unhooking of cisplatin-induced ICLs was observed at 48 hours, but no unhooking of melphalan-induced ICLs. In vitro, A549 cells were proficient at unhooking both melphalan and cisplatin-induced ICLs. gamma-H2AX foci formation closely followed the formation of ICLs for both drugs, and rapidly declined following the peak of formation. RPMI8226 cells unhooked melphalan, but not cisplatin-induced ICLs. In these cells, although cross-links form with cisplatin, the gamma-H2AX response is weak. In A549 cells, addition of 3nM gemcitabine resulted in complete inhibition of cisplatin-induced ICL unhooking but no effect  on repair of melphalan ICLs. The RAD51 foci response was both drug and cell line  specific. Real time PCR studies highlighted differences in the damage response to melphalan and cisplatin following equi-ICL forming doses. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the mechanisms by which melphalan and cisplatin-induced ICLs are 'unhooked' in vitro are distinct, and the mechanisms of clinical acquired resistance involving repair of ICLs, are drug specific.\",\n",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Tumour budding was investigated in 105 patients with NPC by immunohistochemistry for pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3). The intensity of budding correlated strongly with T classification (P=0.008), lymphatic invasion (P<0.001), vascular invasion (P=0.029), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), and clinical stage (P=0.010). Univariate analysis revealed that patients with high budding grade had poorer survival than those with low grade (P=0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that tumour budding was an independent predictor of  survival (P=0.001). Furthermore, budding cells showed high-level expression of the cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ALDH1. Budding cells with high-level ALDH1 expression contributed to several aggressive behaviours and poor survival (P=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: We describe, for the first time, the presence of tumour budding and its correlation with aggressive tumour behaviour and poor patient survival in NPC. The degree of tumour budding could be a valuable predictive factor in NPC.

However, the status of CHD1L protein expression in ovarian cancer and its clinical/prognostic significance are obscure. METHODS: In  this study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CHD1L was performed on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 102 primary ovarian carcinomas and 44 metastatic lesions (omental metastasis). Receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to  evaluate patients' survival status. RESULTS: There is an augmented tendency of CHD1L expression in ovarian carcinoma metastasis than in primary lesions (P<0.05). A significant association was found between positive expression of CHD1L and tumors histological type (P <0.05). By univariate survival analysis of  the ovarian carcinoma cohorts, positive expression of CHD1L was significantly correlated with shortened patient survival (mean 66.7 months versus 97.4 months,  P<0.05). Moreover, CHD1L expression was evaluated to be a significant and independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence that positive expression of CHD1L protein is significantly correlated with the metastasis proceeding of ovarian carcinoma, and CHD1L protein expression, as examined by IHC, may act as a novel prognostic biomarker for patients with ovarian carcinoma.\",\n",

METHODS: Using the same murine RIF model we utilized an optical  imaging technique and fluorescence microscopy to investigate the uptake of chitosan/fluorescently labeled siRNA nanoparticles by peritoneal macrophages and  their subsequent migration to the inflamed tissue in the RIF model. RESULTS: We observed strong accumulation of the fluorescent signal in the lesion site of the  irradiated leg up to 24 hours using the optical imaging system. We further confirm by immunohistochemical staining that Cy3 labeled siRNA resides in macrophages of the irradiated leg.

Recently it has been suggested that the evidence for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) treatment is sufficient to support its regular clinical use. Primary objective in this systematic review was to assess efficacy and safety of NSAID treatment in improving body weight and muscle mass in patients with cancer cachexia. Secondary objectives were to assess whether this treatment could improve other cachexia domains such as anorexia and food intake, catabolic drive and function. MATERIAL  AND METHODS: A systematic literature review of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central register of controlled trials database was carried out using both text words and MeSH/EMTREE terms. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included; all but two trials showed either improvement or stabilization in weight or lean body mass. Seven studies were without a comparator. Studies are generally small and a few are methodologically flawed, often due to multiple outcomes with excess risk of false positives. CONCLUSION: NSAIDs may improve weight in cancer patients with cachexia, and there is some evidence on effect on physical performance, self-reported quality of life and inflammatory parameters. Evidence is too frail  to recommend NSAID for cachexia outside clinical trials.

Primary efficacy and tolerability results from a phase II single-arm study of first-line panitumumab plus FOLFIRI in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have been reported. Here we report additional descriptive tolerability and quality of life data from this trial. METHODS: Integument-related toxicities and quality of life were analysed; toxicities were  graded using modified National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to and duration of first integument-related toxicity were prepared. Quality of life was measured using EuroQoL EQ-5D and EORTC QLQ-C30. Best overall response was analysed by skin toxicity grade and baseline quality of life. Change in quality of life was analysed by skin toxicity severity. RESULTS: 154 patients were enrolled (WT KRAS n = 86; mutant KRAS n = 59); most (98%) experienced integument-related toxicities (most commonly rash [42%], dry skin [40%] and acne [36%]). Median time to first integument-related toxicity was 8 days; median duration was 334 days. Overall, proportionally more patients with grade 2+ skin toxicity responded (56%) compared with those with grade 0/1 (29%). Mean overall EQ-5D health state index scores (0.81 vs. 0.78), health rating scores (72.5 vs. 71.0) and QLQ-C30 global health status scores (65.8 vs. 66.7) were comparable at baseline vs. safety follow-up (8 weeks after completion), respectively and appeared unaffected by skin toxicity severity.

Univariate analysis revealed that non-pancreatic cancer (P = 0.018) and contrast injection into the pancreatic duct (P = 0.030) were significant predictive factors for pancreatitis. Multivariate analysis revealed that non-pancreatic cancer (odds ratio [OR], 4.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-14.18; P = 0.007) and contrast injection into the pancreatic duct (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.33-9.60; P = 0.016) were significant independent predictive factors for pancreatitis. On the other hand, univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that tumor involvement to the orifice of the cystic duct (OCD) was a significant  independent predictive factor for cholecystitis (OR, 5.85; 95% CI, 1.91-27.74; P  = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Non-pancreatic cancer and contrast injection into the pancreatic duct were predictive factors for pancreatitis, and tumor involvement to the OCD was a positive predictive factor for cholecystitis after endoscopic covered SEMS placement for distal malignant biliary obstruction.',\n",

However, it is unclear whether ALK alterations are acquired during the metastatic progression of NSCLC. METHODS AND RESULTS: ALK status and ALK expression were evaluated in a series of 67 primary NSCLCs and their corresponding metastatic lesions using fluorescence in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. ALK rearrangement was detected in 7.5% (5/67) of the primary tumours and in 9.0% (6/67) of the metastases (P < 0.001).

Oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily showed excellent efficacy in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, with objective response rates of 61% and 51% in ongoing phase I and II studies, respectively. Objective response rates of current standard, single-agent, second-line therapies are less than 10%. Median progression-free survival was 10 months (95% confidence interval, 8.2-14.7) in the phase I study expanded cohort and has yet to be reached in the phase II study; progression-free survival with current therapies is less than 3 months. Crizotinib was well tolerated; grade 1/2 gastrointestinal toxicity and visual disturbances were the most common adverse events. Patients in the phase II study reported improvements  in fatigue, dyspnea, and cough, based on quality of life assessments. Phase III studies investigating crizotinib for the first- and second-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, versus current standards of care, are ongoing. Crizotinib represents a new standard of care for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and highlights the importance of the role of the pathologist, as molecular profiling becomes a part of initial workups for newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC.

METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis by using 20 eligible studies to examine polymorphisms of ERCC1, GSTs, TS and MTHFR in predicting clinical outcomes (response rate, overall survival and toxicity) of GC patients treated with platinum/5-Fu-based chemotherapy. The association was measured using random/fixed effect odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) combined with their  95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to the studies' heterogeneity. Statistical analysis was performed with the software STATA 9.0 package. RESULTS:  No significant association was found between response rate and genetic polymorphism in TS, MTHFR, ERCC1, GSTM1 and GSTP1. However, response rate was higher in GSTT1 (+) genotype compared with GSTT1 (-) genotype (T-/T+: OR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.47-0.97). With regard to long term outcomes, we could observe a significant longer overall survival in TS 3R/3R [(2R2R+2R3R)/3R3R: HR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.02-1.64] and GSTP1 GG/GA [(GG+AG)/AA: HR=0.51, 95% CI: (0.39, 0.67)] genotypes. In addition, significant association was demonstrated between toxicity and genetic polymorphism in TS, MTHFR and GSTP1 in included studies. CONCLUSION:  Polymorphisms of ERCC1, GSTs, TS and MTHFR were closely associated with clinical  outcomes of GC patients treated with platinum/5-Fu-based chemotherapy. Studies with large sample size using the method of multi-variant analyses may help us to  give more persuasive data on the putative association in future.\",\n",

We aimed to establish whether oral availability and brain penetration of vemurafenib could be restricted by the multidrug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), as these might limit therapeutic efficacy, especially against brain metastases. In vitro, vemurafenib  was efficiently transported by both human ABCB1 and ABCG2, and very efficiently by mouse Abcg2, but not by mouse Abcc2. Upon oral administration of vemurafenib (5 mg/kg), Abcb1a/1b(-/-) mice had a 1.6-fold increased, Abcg2(-/-) mice a 2.3-fold increased, and Abcb1a/1b(-/-);Abcg2(-/-) mice a 6.6-fold increased plasma AUC, respectively, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, indicating a marked and additive role of these transporters in limiting vemurafenib oral availability. Brain-to-plasma ratios of vemurafenib (oral, 25 mg/kg) were not increased in Abcg2(-/-) mice, only 1.7-fold in Abcb1a/1b(-/-) mice, but 21.4-fold in Abcb1a/1b(-/-);Abcg2(-/-) mice, indicating pronounced overlapping functions of these transporters in reducing vemurafenib brain accumulation. Oral coadministration of the dual ABCB1 and ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar almost completely eliminated the roles of Abcb1 and Abcg2 in restricting oral availability and brain accumulation of vemurafenib. As predicted by previously described pharmacokinetic modeling, halving the amount of active efflux transport at the WT blood-brain barrier by testing heterozygous Abcb1a/1b(+/-);Abcg2(+/-) mice had little impact on vemurafenib brain accumulation.

A number of studies, therefore, have been carried out to identify factors reflecting prognostic outcomes following radical prostatectomy, which would be potentially helpful for  properly counseling individual patients undergoing this surgery. Furthermore, various types of model systems using multiple clinicopathological parameters, such as the nomogram, look-up table and artificial neural network, have been shown to have better performance in postoperative prognostic prediction than the  opinions of expert clinicians.

The use of  biomarkers to detect a cancer early, especially prostate cancer, is not a new idea and PSA has been proved to be the best biomarker for the early diagnosis of  prostate cancer. Since the introduction and wide use of PSA various efforts have  been made to find novel biomarkers in both serum and urine of individuals at high risk for prostate cancer. The best example of a biomarker detected in the urine after a vigorous digital rectal examination is PCA3, which is used mainly in the  subgroup of patients with PSA 4-10 ng/mL whose prostate biopsy was repeatedly negative for prostate cancer in order to decide the performance or not of a new biopsy. Proteomics is a state of the art new biotechnology used to identify the proteome of a certain tissue meaning the whole group of proteins related to the anatomy and biochemistry of the tissue. Using proteomics can effectively and more specifically identify proteins that can be used as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Zinc alpha2-glycoprotein has been studied in  the past as a protein related to cancer cachexia and it has been measured in both prostate tissue and serum in patients with prostate cancer. Zinc alpha2-glycoprotein has also been recently identified by proteomics in prostate tissue showing different values in patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. It is the first time that zinc alpha2-glycoprotein has been systematically measured and studied in an easily obtained biological fluid such as urine showing a very optimistic potential both as a novel solo biomarker and as an adjunct to PSA for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. PSA has revolutionized the way we approximate prostate cancer diagnosis. Even though PSA  is still the best biomarker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer it constitutes an organ-specific and not a disease-specific biomarker and diagnostic dilemmas are often raised concerning the performance or not of a prostate biopsy. Thus novel biomarkers are required in order to improve the diagnostic ability of PSA.  Increasingly in the literature it is stated that the future of prostate cancer diagnosis could be not a single biomarker but a band of different biomarkers that as a total could give the possibility of an individual having prostate cancer. By detecting and measuring zinc alpha2-glycoprotein in the urine we believe that interesting conclusions can be made: first that proteomics is the way to detect with accuracy proteins that could be proved to be valuable novel biomarkers; second that zinc alpha2-glycoprotein detected in the urine could be used both as  a solo biomarker and as an adjunct to PSA for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: * To examine the potential utility as a novel biomarker in the urine of zinc alpha2-glygoprotein (ZAG) for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: * The urine of 127 consecutive candidates for a transrectal ultrasound prostatic biopsy with a mean age of 65.7 +/- 8.7 years and mean PSA 9.1 +/- 5.3 ng/mL was collected. * Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry for ZAG were performed. * Receiver operating characteristic  curves and logistic regression models were used to estimate the predictive ability of ZAG and to determine the optimal sensitivity and specificity by using  various cut-off values for the prediction of prostate cancer. RESULTS: * In all,  42 patients had prostate cancer, 29 showed high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 56 were negative. * Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant predictive ability of ZAG for prostate cancer. The  area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of prostate cancer was 0.68 (95% CI 0.59-0.78). * The combination of ZAG with PSA showed a significant improvement in the predictive ability (P= 0.010), with AUC equal to 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.85). Separate analysis in patients with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL (70.1%) showed that ZAG had a discriminative power with AUC equal to 0.68. * The optimal cut-off was  1.13 for ZAG, which corresponded to 6.88 times greater odds for prostate cancer.  CONCLUSIONS: * Urine detected ZAG showed promising results in the prediction of prostate cancer. * Further validation is required to establish ZAG as a novel biomarker.\",\n",

We reviewed patients undergoing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) to evaluate if those with metabolic syndrome had more aggressive disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective database of patients undergoing RARP between January 2005 and December 2008 (n = 2756) was queried for components of metabolic syndrome (BMI >/= 30 and >/= 2 of the following: hypertension, diabetes or elevated blood glucose, and dyslipidemia; n = 357). Patients with no components of metabolic syndrome were used as controls (n = 694). Biopsy and final pathology were compared between the 2 groups using all controls, and using best-matched controls (n = 357) based on greedy matching by propensity score. RESULTS: Compared with unmatched controls, metabolic syndrome patients had higher pathology Gleason grade (>/= 7: 78% vs. 64%, P < 0.001) and higher pathologic stage (>/= T3 disease: 43% vs. 31%, P < 0.001). After controlling for confounders, those with metabolic syndrome when compared with best-matched controls had maintained the greater pathology Gleason grade (>/= 7: 78% vs. 64%, P < 0.001) and pathologic stage (>/= T3 disease: 43% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). They also had significantly greater pathologic upgrading of Gleason grade 6 adenocarcinoma found on biopsy compared with best-matched controls (63% vs. 45%, P < 0.001). On pathology, a 2-fold increase in Gleason 8 and greater was noted between patients with metabolic syndrome and best-matched controls (15% vs. 8%). CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for confounders, patients with metabolic syndrome were found to have  higher Gleason grade and tumor stage on final pathology and were more likely to have upgrading.',\n",

       " '23020944': {'AB': \"OBJECTIVE: Cancer can involve the airways, causing various degrees of obstruction. Usually, after days or months of mild to moderate undervalued symptoms, severe dyspnea arises abruptly, imposing an immediate attempt to restore the airflow regardless of the etiology. This study focuses on the development of a predictive preintervention model that is useful when deciding whether to perform therapeutic interventional bronchoscopy in patients with severe central airway obstruction. METHODS: A total of 804 patients who underwent rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia to treat severe neoplastic central airway obstruction from 1990 to 2009 were studied. Electronic records for patients who underwent bronchoscopy were analyzed. The patients were primarily male (n = 618, 76.9%) and the median age was 62 years. Lung cancer was the most frequent cause of neoplastic airway obstruction (n = 645, 81.65%). An estimate of the probability of individual endoscopic success was made. RESULTS: Of the 804 patients with severe neoplastic airway obstruction, 681 (84.7%) achieved luminal  clearance, and the procedure was considered an endoscopic success. Tracheal involvement (rate ratio, 1.21; range, 1.16-1.27) endoluminal mass (rate ratio, 1.13; range, 1.06-1.12), and extrinsic compression (rate ratio, 1.17; 1.11-1.17)  were associated significantly with a favorable endoscopic outcome. Tumor location and any kind of mucosal infiltration were the main determinants of the predictive preoperative model of intervention success. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic characteristics and location of the neoplastic lesions are the major determinants of patients' endoscopic outcome. The preintervention model adds to the clinical evaluation an important contribution to the decision-making process on performing therapeutic interventional bronchoscopy in a critical setting.\",\n",
