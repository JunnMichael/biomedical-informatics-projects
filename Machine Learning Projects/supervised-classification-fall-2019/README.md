Popular supervised ML techniques for classification were used (Decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes, and support vector machines). Several datasets were used from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).

Dataset 1: Breast Cancer<br>
Dataset 2: Hyperthyroidism<br>
Dataset 3: Cervical Cancer<br>
Dataset 4: Liver Cancer
